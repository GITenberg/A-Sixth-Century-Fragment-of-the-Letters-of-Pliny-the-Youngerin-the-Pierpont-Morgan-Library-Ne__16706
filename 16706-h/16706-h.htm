<h2>PREFATORY NOTE.</h2>

<p><span class = "textletter">T</span>
HE Pierpont Morgan Library, itself a work of art, contains masterpieces
of painting and sculpture, rare books, and illuminated manuscripts.
Scholars generally are perhaps not aware that it also possesses the
oldest Latin manuscripts in America, including several that even the
greatest European libraries would be proud to own. The collection is
also admirably representative of the development of script throughout
the Middle Ages. It comprises specimens of the uncial hand, the
half-uncial, the Merovingian minuscule of the Luxeuil type, the script
of the famous school of Tours, the St. Gall type, the Irish and
Visigothic hands, and the Beneventan and Anglo-Saxon scripts.</p>

<p>Among the oldest manuscripts of the library, in fact the oldest, is a
hitherto unnoticed fragment of great significance not only to
palaeographers, but to all students of the classics. It consists of six
leaves of an early sixth-century manuscript of the <i>Letters</i> of the
younger Pliny. This new witness to the text, older by three centuries
than the oldest codex heretofore used by any modern editor, has
reappeared in this unexpected quarter, after centuries of wandering and
hiding. The fragment was bought by the late J. Pierpont Morgan in Rome,
in December 1910, from the art dealer Imbert; he had obtained it from De
Marinis, of Florence, who had it from the heirs of the Marquis Taccone,
of Naples. Nothing is known of the rest of the manuscript.</p>

<p>The present writers had the good fortune to visit the Pierpont Morgan
Library in 1915. One of the first manuscripts put into their hands was
this early sixth-century fragment of Pliny’s <i>Letters</i>, which forms
the subject of the following pages. Having received permission to study
the manuscript and publish results, they lost no time in acquainting
classical scholars with this important find. In December of the same
year, at the joint meeting of the American Archaeological and
Philological Associations, held at Princeton University, two papers were
read, one concerning the palaeographical, the other the textual,
importance of the fragment. The two studies which follow, Part I by
Doctor Lowe, Part II by Professor Rand, are an elaboration of the views
presented at the meeting. Some months after the present volume was in
the form of page-proof, Professor E.&nbsp;T. Merrill’s long-expected
edition of Pliny’s <i>Letters</i> appeared (Teubner, Leipsic, 1922).
We regret that we could not avail ourselves of it in time to introduce
certain changes. The reader will still find Pliny cited by the pages of
Keil, and in general he should regard the date of our production as 1921
rather than 1922.</p>

The writers wish to express their gratitude for the privilege of
visiting the Pierpont Morgan Library and making full use of its
facilities. For permission to publish the manuscript they are indebted
to the generous interest of Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan. They also desire to
make cordial acknowledgment of the unfailing courtesy and helpfulness of
the Librarian, Miss Belle da Costa Greene, and her assistant, Miss Ada
Thurston. Lastly, the writers wish to thank the Carnegie Institution of
Washington for accepting their joint study for publication and for their
liberality in permitting them to give all the facsimiles necessary to
illustrate the discussion.</p>

HE Morgan fragment of Pliny the Younger contains the end of Book II and
the beginning of Book III of the <i>Letters</i> (II, xx. 13-III, v. 4).
The fragment consists of six vellum leaves, or twelve pages, which
apparently formed part of a gathering or quire of the original
volume.</p>

<p>The leaves measure 11-3/8 by 7 inches (286 x 180 millimeters); the
written space measures 7-1/4 by 4-3/8 inches (175 x 114 millimeters);
outer margin, 1-7/8 inches (50 millimeters); inner, 3/4 inch (18
millimeters); upper margin, 1-3/4 inches (45 millimeters); lower, 2-1/4
inches (60 millimeters).</p>

<p>The vellum is well prepared and of medium thickness. The leaves are
bound in a modern pliable vellum binding with three blank vellum
fly-leaves in front and seven in back, all modern. On the inside of the
front cover is the book-plate of John Pierpont Morgan, showing the
Morgan arms with the device: <i>Onward and Upward</i>. Under the
book-plate is the press-mark M.462.</p>


<p class = "section">
<span class = "sidenote">
<a name = "frag_2">Ruling</a>
</span>
There are twenty-seven horizontal lines to a page and two vertical
bounding lines. The lines were ruled with a hard point on the flesh
side, each opened sheet being ruled separately: 48<sup>v</sup> and
53<sup>r</sup>, 49<sup>r</sup> and 52<sup>v</sup>, 50<sup>v</sup> and
51<sup>r</sup>. The horizontal lines were guided by knife-slits made in
the outside margins quite close to the text space; the two vertical
lines were guided by two slits in the upper margin and two in the lower.
The horizontal lines were drawn across the open sheets and extended
occasionally beyond the slits, more often just beyond the perpendicular
bounding lines. The written space was kept inside the vertical bounding
lines except for the initial letter of each epistle; the first letter of
the address and the first letter of the epistle proper projected into
the left margin. Here and there the scribe transgressed beyond the
bounding line. On the whole, however, he observed the limits and seemed
to prefer to leave a blank before the bounding line rather than to crowd
the syllable into the space or go beyond the vertical line.</p>

</span>
One might suppose that the six leaves once formed a complete gathering
of the original book, especially as the first and last pages, folios
48<sup>r</sup> and 53<sup>v</sup> have a darker appearance, as though
they had been the outside leaves of a gathering that had been affected
by exposure. But this darker appearance is sufficiently accounted for by
the fact that both pages are on the hair side of the parchment, and the
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<a name = "page_4"> </a>
hair side is always darker than the flesh side. Quires of six leaves or
trinions are not unknown. Examples of them may be found in our oldest
manuscripts. But they are the exception.<a name = "tagI_1" href =
"#noteI_1"><sup>1</sup></a> The customary quire is a gathering of eight
leaves, forming a quaternion proper. It would be natural, therefore, to
suppose that our fragment did not constitute a complete gathering in
itself but formed part of a quaternion. The supposition is confirmed by
the following considerations:</p>

<p>In the first place, if our six leaves were once a part of a
quaternion, the two leaves needed to complete them must have formed the
outside sheet, since our fragment furnishes a continuous text without
any lacuna whatever. Now, in the formation of quires, sheets were so
arranged that hair side faced hair side, and flesh side flesh side. This
arrangement is dictated by a sense of uniformity. As the hair side is
usually much darker than the flesh side the juxtaposition of hair and
flesh sides would offend the eye. So, in the case of our six leaves,
folios 48<sup>v</sup> and 53<sup>r</sup>, presenting the flesh side,
face folios 49<sup>r</sup> and 52<sup>v</sup> likewise on the flesh
side; and folios 49<sup>v</sup> and 52<sup>r</sup> presenting the hair
side, face folios 50<sup>r</sup> and 51<sup>v</sup> likewise on the hair
side. The inside pages 50<sup>v</sup> and 51<sup>r</sup> which face each
other, are both flesh side, and the outside pages 48<sup>r</sup> and
53<sup>v</sup> are both hair side, as may be seen from the accompanying
diagram.</p>

<p class = "image">
<img src = "images/fig_04.png" width = "375" height = "191"
alt = "diagram of manuscript as described in text"
title = "diagram of manuscript">
</p>

<p>From this arrangement it is evident that if our fragment once formed
part of a quaternion the missing sheet was so folded that its hair side
faced the present outside sheet and its flesh side was on the outside of
the whole gathering. Now, it was by far the more usual practice in our
oldest uncial manuscripts to have the flesh side on the outside of the
quire.<a name = "tagI_2" href = "#noteI_2"><sup>2</sup></a> And as our
fragment belongs to the oldest
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<a name = "page_5"> </a>
class of uncial manuscripts, the manner of arranging the sheets of
quires seems to favor the supposition that two outside leaves are
missing. The hypothesis is, moreover, strengthened by another
consideration. According to the foliation supplied by the
fifteenth-century Arabic numerals, the leaf which must have followed our
fragment bore the number 54, the leaf preceding it having the number 47.
If we assume that our fragment was a complete gathering, we are obliged
to explain why the next gathering began on a leaf bearing an even number
(54), which is abnormal. We do not have to contend with this difficulty
if we assume that folios 47 and 54 formed the outside sheet of our
fragment, for six quires of eight leaves and one of six would give
precisely 54 leaves. It seems, therefore, reasonable to assume that our
fragment is not a complete unit, but formed part of a quaternion, the
outside sheet of which is missing.</p>

</span>
In the fifteenth century, as the previous demonstration has made clear,
our fragment was preceded by 47 leaves that are missing to-day. With
this clue in our possession it can be demonstrated that the manuscript
began with the first book of the <i>Letters</i>. We start with the fact
that not all the 47 folios (or 94 pages) which preceded our six leaves
were devoted to the text of the <i>Letters</i>. For, from the contents
of our six leaves we know that each book must have been preceded by an
index of addresses and first lines. The indices for Books I and II, if
arranged in general like that of Book III, must have occupied four
pages.<a name = "tagI_3" href = "#noteI_3"><sup>3</sup></a> We also
learn from our fragment that space must be allowed for a colophon at the
end of each book. One page for the colophons of Books I and II is a
reasonable allowance. Accordingly it follows that out of the 94 pages
preceding our fragment 5 were not devoted to text, or in other words
that only 89 pages were thus devoted.</p>

<p>Now, if we compare pages in our manuscript with pages of a printed
text we find that the average page in our manuscript corresponds to
about 19 lines of the Teubner edition of 1912. If we multiply 89 by 19
we get 1691. This number of lines of the size of the Teubner edition
should, if our calculation be correct, contain the text of the
<i>Letters</i> preceding our fragment. The average page of the Teubner
edition of 1912 of the part which interests us contains a little over 29
lines. If we divide 1691 by 29 we get 58.3. Just 58 pages of Teubner
text are occupied by the 47 leaves which preceded our fragment. So close
a conformity is sufficient to prove our point. We have possibly allowed
too much space for indices and colophons, especially if the former
covered less ground for
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
<a name = "page_6"> </a>
Books I and II than for Book III. Further, owing to the abbreviation of
<i>que</i> and <i>bus</i>, and particularly of official titles, we can
not expect a closer agreement.</p>

<p>It is not worth while to attempt a more elaborate calculation. With
the edges matching so nearly, it is obvious that the original manuscript
as known and used in the fifteenth century could not have contained some
other work, however brief, before Book I of Pliny’s <i>Letters</i>. If
the manuscript contained the entire ten books it consisted of about 260
leaves. This sum is obtained by counting the number of lines in the
Teubner edition of 1912, dividing this sum by 19, and adding thereto
pages for colophons and indices. It would be too bold to suppose that
this calculation necessarily gives us the original size of the
manuscript, since the manuscript may have had less than ten books, or it
may, on the other hand, have had other works. But if it contained only
the ten books of the <i>Letters</i>, then 260 folios is an approximately
correct estimate of its size.</p>

<p>It is hard to believe that only six leaves of the original manuscript
have escaped destruction. The fact that the outside sheet (foll.
48<sup>r</sup> and 53<sup>v</sup>) is not much worn nor badly soiled
suggests that the gathering of six leaves must have been torn from the
manuscript not so very long ago and that the remaining portions may some
day be found.</p>


<p class = "section">
<span class = "sidenote">
<a name = "frag_5">Disposition</a>
</span>
The pages in our manuscript are written in long lines,<a name = "tagI_4"
href = "#noteI_4"><sup>4</sup></a> in <i>scriptura continua</i>, with
hardly any punctuation.</p>

<p>Each page begins with a large letter, even though that letter occur
in the body of a word (cf. foll. 48<sup>r</sup>, 51<sup>v</sup>,
52<sup>r</sup>).<a name = "tagI_5" href =
"#noteI_5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Each epistle begins with a large letter. The line containing the
address which precedes each epistle also begins with a large letter. In
both cases the large letter projects into the left margin.</p>

<p>The running title at the top of each page is in small rustic
capitals.<a name = "tagI_6" href = "#noteI_6"><sup>6</sup></a> On the
verso of each folio stands the word EPISTVLARVM; on the recto of the
following folio stands the number of the book, <i>e.g.</i>, LIB. II,
LIB. III.</p>

<p>To judge by our fragment, each book was preceded by an index of
addresses
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
<a name = "page_7"> </a>
and initial lines written in alternating lines of black and red uncials.
Alternating lines of black and red rustic capitals of a large size were
used in the colophon.<a name = "tagI_7" href =
"#noteI_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>


<p class = "section">
<span class = "sidenote">
<a name = "frag_6">Ornamentation</a>
</span>
As in all our oldest Latin manuscripts, the ornamentation is of the
simplest kind. Such as it is, it is mostly found at the end and
beginning of books. In our case, the colophon is enclosed between two
scrolls of vine-tendrils terminating in an ivy-leaf at both ends. The
lettering in the colophon and in the running title is set off by means
of ticking above and below the line.</p>

<p>Red is used for decorative purposes in the middle line of the
colophon, in the scroll of vine-tendrils, in the ticking, and in the
border at the end of the Index on fol. 49. Red was also used, to judge
by our fragment, in the first three lines of a new book,<a name =
"tagI_8" href = "#noteI_8"><sup>8</sup></a> in the addresses in the
Index, and in the addresses preceding each letter.</p>

<p class = "section">
<span class = "sidenote">
<a name = "frag_7">Corrections</a>
</span>
The original scribe made a number of corrections. The omitted line of
the Index on fol. 49 was added between the lines, probably by the scribe
himself, using a finer pen; likewise the omitted line on fol.
52<sup>v</sup>, lines 7-8. A number of slight corrections come either
from the scribe or from a contemporary reader; the others are by a
somewhat later hand, which is probably not more recent than the seventh
century.<a name = "tagI_9" href = "#noteI_9"><sup>9</sup></a> The method
of correcting varies. As a rule, the correct letter is added above the
line over the wrong letter; occasionally it is written over an erasure.
An omitted letter is also added above the line over the space where it
should be inserted. Deletion of single letters is indicated by a dot
placed over the letter and a horizontal or an oblique line drawn through
it. This double use of expunction and cancellation is not uncommon in
our oldest manuscripts. For details on the subject of corrections, see
the notes on <a href = "#page_23">pp. 23-34</a>.</p>

<p>There is a ninth-century addition on fol. 53 and one of the fifteenth
century on fol. 51. On fol. 49, in the upper margin, a fifteenth-century
hand using a stilus or hard point scribbled a few words, now difficult
to decipher.<a name = "tagI_10" href = "#noteI_10"><sup>10</sup></a>
Presumably the same hand drew a bearded head with a halo. Another
relatively recent hand, using lead, wrote in the left margin of fol.
53<sup>v</sup> the monogram QR<a name = "tagI_11" href =
"#noteI_11"><sup>11</sup></a> and the roman numerals i, ii, iii under
one another. These numerals, as Professor
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<a name = "page_8"> </a>
Rand correctly saw, refer to the works of Pliny the Elder enumerated in
the text. Further activity by this hand, the date of which it is
impossible to determine, may be seen, for example, on fol.
49<sup>v</sup>, ll. 8, 10, 15; fol. 52, ll. 4, 10, 13, 21, 22; fol. 53,
ll. 12, 15, 16, 17, 20, 27; fol. 53<sup>v</sup>, ll. 5, 10, 15.</p>

<a name = "frag_8">Syllabification</a>
</span>
Syllables are divided after a vowel or diphthong except where such a
division involves beginning the next syllable with a group of
consonants.<a name = "tagI_12" href = "#noteI_12"><sup>12</sup></a> In
that case the consonants are distributed between the two syllables, one
consonant going with one syllable and the other with the following,
except when the group contains more than two successive consonants, in
which case the first consonant goes with the first syllable, the rest
with the following syllable. That the scribe is controlled by this
mechanical rule and not by considerations of pronunciation is obvious
from the division <span class = "smallcaps">san|ctissimum</span> and
other examples found below. The method followed by him is made amply
clear by the examples which occur in our twelve pages:<a name =

The spelling found in our six leaves is remarkably correct. It compares
favorably with the best spelling encountered in our oldest Latin
manuscripts of the fourth and fifth centuries. The diphthong <i>ae</i>
is regularly distinguished from <i>e</i>. The interchange of <i>b</i>
and <i>u</i>, <i>d</i> and <i>t</i>, <i>o</i> and <i>u</i>, so common in
later manuscripts, is rare here: the confusion between <i>b</i> and
<i>u</i> occurs once (<i>comprouasse</i>, fo. 52<sup>v</sup>, l. 1); the
omission of <i>h</i> occurs once (<i>pulcritudo</i>, fo. 51<sup>v</sup>,
l. 26); the use of <i>k</i> for <i>c</i> occurs twice (<i>karet</i>, fo.
51<sup>r</sup>, l. 14, and <i>karitas</i>, fo. 52<sup>r</sup>, l. 5).
The scribe uses the correct forms in <i>adolescet</i> (fo.
51<sup>v</sup>, l. 14) and <i>adulescenti</i> (fo. 51<sup>v</sup>, l.
24); he writes <i>auonculi</i> (fo. 53<sup>v</sup>, l. 15),
<i>exsistat</i> (fo. 51<sup>v</sup>, l. 9), and <i>exsecutos</i> (fo.
53<sup>r</sup>, l. 8). In the case of composite words he has the
assimilated form in some, and in others the unassimilated form, as the
following examples go to show:</p>

<a name = "frag_11">Authenticity of the six leaves</a>
</span>
The sudden appearance in America of a portion of a very ancient
classical manuscript unknown to modern editors may easily arouse
suspicion in the minds of some scholars. Our experience with the
“Anonymus Cortesianus” has taught us to be wary,<a name = "tagI_20" href
= "#noteI_20"><sup>20</sup></a> and it is natural to demand proof
establishing the genuineness of the new fragment.<a name = "tagI_21"
href = "#noteI_21"><sup>21</sup></a> As to the six leaves of the Morgan
Pliny, it may be said unhesitatingly that no one with experience of
ancient Latin manuscripts could entertain any doubt as to their
genuineness. The look and feel of the parchment, the ink, the script,
the titles, colophons, ornamentation, corrections, and later additions,
all bear the indisputable marks of genuine antiquity.</p>

<p>But it may be objected that a clever forger possessing a knowledge of
palaeography would be able to reproduce all these features of ancient
manuscripts. This objection can hardly be sustained. It is difficult to
believe that any modern could reproduce faithfully all the
characteristics of sixth-century uncials and fifteenth-century notarial
writing without unconsciously falling into some error and betraying his
modernity. Besides, there is one consideration which to my mind
establishes the genuineness of our fragment beyond a peradventure. We
have seen above that the leaves of our manuscript are so arranged that
hair side faces hair side and flesh side faces flesh side. The visible
effect of this arrangement is that two pages of clear writing alternate
with two pages of faded writing, the faded appearance being caused by
the ink scaling off from the less porous surface of the flesh side of
the vellum.<a name = "tagI_22" href = "#noteI_22"><sup>22</sup></a> As a
matter of fact, the flesh side of the vellum showed
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<a name = "page_12"> </a>
faded writing long before modern time. To judge by the retouched
characters on fol. 53<sup>r</sup> it would seem that the original
writing had become illegible by the eighth or ninth century.<a name =
"tagI_23" href = "#noteI_23"><sup>23</sup></a> Still, a considerable
period of time would, so far as we know, be necessary for this process.
It is highly improbable that a forger could devise this method of giving
his forgery the appearance of antiquity, and even if he attempted it, it
is safe to say that the present effect would not be produced in the time
that elapsed before the book was sold to Mr. Morgan.</p>

<p>But let us assume, for the sake of argument, that the Morgan fragment
is a modern forgery. We are then constrained to credit the forger not
only with a knowledge of palaeography which is simply faultless, but, as
will be shown in the second part, with a minute acquaintance with the
criticism and the history of the text. And this forger did not try to
attain fame or academic standing by his nefarious doings, as was the
case with the Roman author of the forged “Anonymus Cortesianus,” for
nothing was heard of this Morgan fragment till it had reached the
library of the American collector. If his motive was monetary gain he
chose a long and arduous path to attain it. It is hardly conceivable
that he should take the trouble to make all the errors and omissions
found in our twelve pages and all the additions and corrections
representing different ages, different styles, when less than half the
number would have served to give the forged document an air of
verisimilitude. The assumption that the Morgan fragment is a forgery
thus becomes highly unreasonable. When you add to this the fact that
there is nothing in the twelve pages that in any way arouses suspicion,
the conclusion is inevitable that the Morgan fragment is a genuine relic
of antiquity.</p>

</span>
As to the original from which our manuscript was copied, very little can
be said. The six leaves before us furnish scanty material on which to
build any theory. The errors which occur are not sufficient to warrant
any conclusion as to the script of the archetype. One item of
information, however, we do get: an omission on fol. 52<sup>v</sup> goes
to show that the manuscript from which our scribe copied was written in
lines of 25 letters or thereabout.<a name = "tagI_24" href =
"#noteI_24"><sup>24</sup></a> The scribe first wrote <span class =
"smallcaps">excucuris|sem commeatu</span>. Discovering his error of
omission, he erased <span class = "smallcaps">sem</span> at the
beginning of line 8 and added it at the end of line 7 (intruding upon
margin-space in order to do so), and then supplied, in somewhat smaller
letters, the omitted words <span class = "smallcaps">accepto ut
praefectus aerari</span>. As there are no <i>homoioteleuta</i> to
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>

account for the omission, it is almost certain that it was caused by the
inadvertent skipping of a line.<a name = "tagI_25" href =

<p>A glance at the abbreviations used in the index of addresses on foll.

manuscript was copied must have had its names abbreviated in exactly the
same form. There is no other way of explaining why the scribe first
wrote <span class = "smallcaps">ad iulium seruianum</span> (fol. 49, l.

<h3><a name = "history">THE DATE AND LATER HISTORY OF THE
MANUSCRIPT.</a></h3>

<p>Our manuscript was written in Italy at the end of the fifth or more
probably at the beginning of the sixth century.</p>

<p>The manuscripts with which we can compare it come, with scarcely an
exception, from Italy; for it is only of more recent uncial manuscripts
(those of the seventh and eighth centuries) that we can say with
certainty that they originate in other than Italian centres. The only
exception which occurs to one is the Codex Bobiensis (k) of the Gospels
of the fifth century, which may actually have been written in Africa,
though this is far from certain. As for our fragment, the details of its
script, as well as the ornamentation, disposition of the page, the ink,
the parchment, all find their parallels in authenticated Italian
products; and this similarity in details is borne out by the general
impression of the whole.</p>

<p>The manuscript may be dated at about the year A.D. 500, for the
reason that the script is not quite so old as that of our oldest
fifth-century uncial manuscripts, and yet decidedly older than that of
the Codex Fuldensis of the Gospels (F) written in or before A.D.
546.</p>


<p class = "section">
<span class = "sidenote">
<a name = "hist_1">On the dating of uncial manuscripts</a>
</span>
In dating uncial manuscripts we must proceed warily, since the data on
which our judgments are based are meagre in the extreme and rather
difficult to formulate.</p>

<p>The history of uncial writing still remains to be written. The chief
value of excellent works like Chatelain’s <i>Uncialis Scriptura</i> or
Zangemeister and Wattenbach’s <i>Exempla Codicum Latinorum Litteris
Maiusculis Scriptorum</i> lies in the mass of material they offer to the
student. This could not well be otherwise, since clear-cut, objective
criteria for dating uncial manuscripts have not yet been formulated; and
that is due to the fact that of our four hundred or more uncial
manuscripts, ranging from the fourth to the eighth century, very few,
indeed, can be dated with
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
<a name = "page_14"> </a>
precision, and of these virtually none is in the oldest class. Yet a few
guide-posts there are. By means of those it ought to be possible not
only to throw light on the development of this script, but also to
determine the features peculiar to the different periods of its history.
This task, of course, can not be attempted here; it may, however, not be
out of place to call attention to certain salient facts.</p>

<p>The student of manuscripts knows that a law of evolution is
observable in writing as in other aspects of human endeavor. The process
of evolution is from the less to the more complex, from the less to the
more differentiated, from the simple to the more ornate form. Guided by
these general considerations, he would find that his uncial manuscripts
naturally fall into two groups. One group is manifestly the older: in
orthography, punctuation, and abbreviation it bears close resemblance to
inscriptions of the classical or Roman period. The other group is as
manifestly composed of the more recent manuscripts: this may be inferred
from the corrupt or barbarous spelling, from the use of abbreviations
unfamiliar in the classical period but very common in the Middle Ages,
or from the presence of punctuation, which the oldest manuscripts
invariably lack. The manuscripts of the first group show letters that
are simple and unadorned and words unseparated from each other. Those of
the second group show a type of ornate writing, the letters having
serifs or hair-lines and flourishes, and the words being well separated.
There can be no reasonable doubt that this rough classification is
correct as far as it goes; but it must remain rough and permit large
play for subjective judgement.</p>

<p>A scientific classification, however, can rest only on objective
criteria&mdash;criteria which, once recognized, are acceptable to all.
Such criteria are made possible by the presence of dated manuscripts.
Now, if by a dated manuscript we mean a manuscript of which we know,
through a subscription or some other entry, that it was written in a
certain year, there is not a single dated manuscript in uncial writing
which is older than the seventh century&mdash;the oldest manuscript with
a <i>precise</i> date known to me being the manuscript of St. Augustine
written in the Abbey of Luxeuil in A.D. 669.<a name = "tagI_26" href =
"#noteI_26"><sup>26</sup></a> But there are a few manuscripts of which
we can say with certainty that they were written either before or after
some given date. And these manuscripts which furnish us with a
<i>terminus ante quem</i> or <i>post quem</i>, as the case may be, are
extremely important to us as being the only relatively safe landmarks
for following development in a field that is both remote and
shadowy.</p>

<p>The Codex Fuldensis of the Gospels, mentioned above, is our first
landmark of importance.<a name = "tagI_27" href =
"#noteI_27"><sup>27</sup></a> It was read by Bishop Victor of Capua in
the years A.D. 546 and 547, as is testified by two entries, probably
autograph. From this it follows that
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
<a name = "page_15"> </a>
the manuscript was written before A.D. 546. We may surmise&mdash;and I
think correctly&mdash;that it was shortly before 546, if not in that
very year. In any case the Codex Fuldensis furnishes a precise
<i>terminus ante quem</i>.</p>

<p>The other landmark of importance is furnished by a Berlin fragment
containing a computation for finding the correct date for Easter
Sunday.<a name = "tagI_28" href = "#noteI_28"><sup>28</sup></a> Internal
evidence makes it clear that this <i>Computus Paschalis</i> first saw
light shortly after A.D. 447. The presumption is that the Berlin leaves
represent a very early copy, if not the original, of this composition.
In no case can these leaves be regarded as a much later copy of the
original, as the following purely palaeographical considerations, that
is, considerations of style and form of letters, will go to show.</p>

<p>Let us assume, as we do in geometry, for the sake of argument, that
the Fulda manuscript and the Berlin fragment were both written about the
year 500&mdash;a date representing, roughly speaking, the middle point
in the period of about one hundred years which separates the extreme
limits of the dates possible for either of these two manuscripts, as the
following diagram illustrates:</p>

<p class = "image">
<img src = "images/fig_15.png" width = "510" height = "50" alt =
"dates of Berlin and Fulda MSS" title = "dates of Berlin and Fulda MSS">
</p>

<p>If our hypothesis be correct, then the script of these two
manuscripts, as well as other palaeographical features, would offer
striking similarities if not close resemblance. As a matter of fact, a
careful comparison of the two manuscripts discloses differences so
marked as to render our assumption absurd. The Berlin fragment is
obviously much older than the Fulda manuscript. It would be rash to
specify the exact interval of time that separates these two manuscripts,
yet if we remember the slow development of types of writing the
conclusion seems justified that at least several generations of
evolution lie between the two manuscripts. If this be correct, we are
forced to push the date of each as far back as the ascertained limit
will permit, namely, the Fulda manuscript to the year 546 and the Berlin
fragment to the year 447. Thus, apparently, considerations of form and
style (purely palaeographical considerations) confirm the dates derived
from examination of the internal evidence, and the Berlin and Fulda
manuscripts may, in effect, be considered two dated manuscripts, two
definite guide-posts.</p>

<p>If the preceding conclusion accords with fact, then we may accept the
traditional date (circa A.D. 371) of the Codex Vercellensis of the
Gospels. The famous Vatican palimpsest of Cicero’s <i>De Re Publica</i>
seems more properly placed in the fourth than in the fifth century; and
the older portion of the Bodleian manuscript of Jerome’s translation of
the <i>Chronicle</i> of Eusebius, dated after the year A.D. 442, becomes
another guide-post in the history of uncial writing, since a comparison
with the Berlin fragment of about A.D. 447 convinces
<span class = "pagenum">16</span>
<a name = "page_16"> </a>
one that the Bodleian manuscript can not have been written much after
the date of its archetype, which is A.D. 442.</p>

<p>Guided by the above manuscripts, we may proceed to determine the
place which the Morgan Pliny occupies in the series of uncial
manuscripts. The student of manuscripts recognizes at a glance that the
Morgan fragment is, as has been said, distinctly older than the Codex
Fuldensis of about the year 546. But how much older? Is it to be
compared in antiquity with such venerable monuments as the palimpsest of
Cicero’s <i>De Re Publica</i>, with products like the Berlin <i>Computus
Paschalis</i> or the Bodleian <i>Chronicle</i> of Eusebius? If we
examine carefully the characteristics of our oldest group of fourth- and
fifth-century manuscripts and compare them with those of the Morgan
manuscript we shall see that the latter, though sharing some of the
features found in manuscripts of the oldest group, lacks others and in
turn shows features peculiar to manuscripts of a later group.</p>

<p class = "section">
<span class = "sidenote">
<a name = "hist_4">Characteristics of the oldest uncial
manuscripts</a>
</span>
The main characteristics of the manuscripts included in the above list,
which is by no means complete, may briefly be described thus:</p>

<p class = "inset1">
1. General effect of compactness. This is the result of <i>scriptura
continua</i>, which knows no separation of words and no punctuation. See
the facsimiles cited above.</p>

<p class = "inset1">
2. Precision in the mode of shading. The alternation of stressed and
unstressed strokes is very regular. The two arcs of <img src =
"images/ltr_19a.png" width = "15" height = "15" alt = "uncial O"
title = "uncial O"> are
shaded not in the middle, as in Greek uncials, but in the lower left and
upper right parts of the letter, so that the space enclosed by the two
arcs resembles an ellipse leaning to the left at an angle of about 45°,
thus <img src = "images/ltr_19a.png" width = "15" height = "15"
alt = "uncial O" title = "uncial O">. What is true of the
<img src = "images/ltr_19a.png" width = "15" height = "15"
alt = "uncial O" title = "uncial O"> is true of other curved strokes.
The strokes are often very short, mere touches of pen to parchment, like
brush work. Often they are unconnected, thus giving a mere suggestion of
the form. The attack or fore-stroke as well as the finishing stroke is a
very fine, oblique hair-line.<a name = "tagI_30" href =
"#noteI_30"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p class = "inset1">
3. Absence of long ascending or descending strokes. The letters lie
virtually between two lines (instead of between four as in later
uncials), the upper and lower shafts of letters like <img src =
"images/ltr_19b.png" width = "75" height = "26" alt = "uncial H L P Q"
title = "uncial H L P Q">
projecting but slightly beyond the head and base lines.</p>

<p class = "inset1">
4. The broadness of the letters <img src = "images/ltr_19c.png" width =
"116" height = "22" alt = "uncial M N U" title = "uncial M N U"></p>

<p class = "inset1">
5. The relative narrowness of the letters <img src =
"images/ltr_19d.png" width = "78" height = "24" alt = "uncial F L P S T"
title = "uncial F L P S
T"></p>

<p class = "inset1">
6. The manner of forming <img src = "images/ltr_19e.png" width = "172"
height = "23" alt = "uncial B E L M N P S T"
title = "uncial B E L M N P S T"></p>

<p class = "hanging2">
<i>B</i> with the lower bow considerably larger than the upper, which
often has the form of a mere comma.</p>

<p class = "hanging2">
<i>E</i> with the tongue or horizontal stroke placed not in the middle,
as in later uncial manuscripts, but high above it, and extending beyond
the upper curve. The loop is often left open.</p>

<p class = "hanging2">
<i>L</i> with very small base.</p>

<p class = "hanging2">
<i>M</i> with the initial stroke tending to be a straight line instead
of the well-rounded bow of later uncials.</p>

<p class = "hanging2">
<i>N</i> with the oblique connecting stroke shaded.</p>

<p class = "hanging2">
<i>P</i> with the loop very small and often open.</p>

<p class = "hanging2">
<i>S</i> with a rather longish form and shallow curves, as compared with
the broad form and ample curves of later uncials.</p>

<p class = "hanging2">
<i>T</i> with a very small, sinuous horizontal top stroke (except at the
beginning of a line when it often has an exaggerated extension to the
left).</p>

<p class = "inset1">
7. Extreme fineness of parchment, at least in parts of the
manuscript.</p>

<p class = "inset1">
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
<a name = "page_20"> </a>
8. Perforation of parchment along furrows made by the pen.</p>

<p class = "inset1">
9. Quires signed by means of roman numerals often preceded by the letter
<i>Q·</i> (=&nbsp;Quaternio) in the lower right corner of the last page
of each gathering.</p>

<p class = "inset1">
10. Running titles, in abbreviated form, usually in smaller uncials than
the text.</p>

<p class = "inset1">
11. Colophons, in which red and black ink alternate, usually in
large-sized uncials.</p>

<p class = "inset1">
12. Use of a capital, <i>i.e.</i>, a larger-sized letter at the
beginning of each page or of each column in the page, even if the
beginning falls in the middle of a word.</p>

<p class = "inset1">
13. Lack of all but the simplest ornamentation, <i>e.g.</i>, scroll or
ivy-leaf.</p>

<p class = "inset1">
14. The restricted use of abbreviations. Besides B· and Q· and such
suspensions as occur in classical inscriptions only the contracted forms
of the <i>Nomina Sacra</i> are found.</p>

<p class = "inset1">
15. Omission of <i>M</i> and <i>N</i> allowed only at the end of a line,
the omission being marked by means of a simple horizontal line (somewhat
hooked at each end) placed above the line after the final vowel and not
directly over it as in later uncial manuscripts.</p>

<p class = "inset1">
16. Absence of nearly all punctuation.</p>

<p class = "inset1">
17. The use of <img src = "images/mark_20a.png" width = "31" height =
"25" alt = "'infra' symbol" title = "'infra'"> in the text where an
omission has occurred, and <img src = "images/mark_20b.png" width = "28"
height = "21" alt = "'supra' symbol" title = "'supra' symbol">
<i>after</i> the supplied omission in the lower margin, or the same
symbols reversed if the supplement is entered in the upper margin.</p>

<p>If we now turn to the Morgan Pliny we observe that it lacks a number
of the characteristics enumerated above as belonging to the oldest type
of uncial manuscripts. The parchment is not of the very thin sort. There
has been no corrosion along the furrows made by the pen. The running
title and colophons are in rustic capitals, not in uncials. The manner
of forming such letters as <img src = "images/ltr_20a.png" width = "115"
height = "20" alt = "uncial B E M R S T" title = "uncial B E M R S T">
differs from that employed in the oldest group.</p>

<p class = "hanging2">
<i>B</i> with the lower bow not so markedly larger than the upper.</p>

<p class = "hanging2">
<i>E</i> with the horizontal stroke placed nearer the middle.</p>

<p class = "hanging2">
<i>M</i> with the left bow tending to become a distinct curve.</p>

<p class = "hanging2">
<i>R S T</i> have gained in breadth and proportionately lost in
height.</p>

</span>
Inasmuch as these palaeographical differences mark a tendency which
reaches fuller development in later uncial manuscripts, it is clear that
their presence in our manuscript is a sign of its more recent character
as compared with manuscripts of the oldest type. Just as our manuscript
is clearly older than the Codex Fuldensis of about the year 546, so it
is clearly more recent than the Berlin <i>Computus Paschalis</i> of
about the year 447. Its proper place is at the end of the oldest series
of uncial manuscripts, which begins with the Cicero palimpsest. Its
closest neighbors are, I believe, the Pliny palimpsest of St. Paul in
Carinthia and the <i>Codex Theodosianus</i> of Turin. If we conclude by
saying that the Morgan manuscript was written about the year 500 we
shall probably not be far from the truth.</p>

<a name = "hist_6">Later history of the Morgan manuscript</a>
</span>
The vicissitudes of a manuscript often throw light upon the history of
the text contained in the manuscript. And the palaeographer knows that
any scratch or scribbling, any <i>probatio pennae</i> or casual entry,
may become important in tracing the wanderings of a manuscript.</p>

<p>In the six leaves that have been saved of our Morgan manuscript we
have two entries. One is of a neutral character and does not take us
further, but the other is very clear and tells an unequivocal story.</p>

<p>The unimportant entry occurs in the lower margin of folio
53<sup>r</sup>. The words “<i>uir erat in terra</i>,” which are
apparently the beginning of the book of Job, are written in Carolingian
characters of the ninth century. As these characters were used during
the ninth century in northern Italy as well as in France, it is
impossible to say where this entry was made. If in France, then the
manuscript of Pliny must have left its Italian home before the ninth
century.<a name = "tagI_31" href = "#noteI_31"><sup>31</sup></a></p>

<p>That it had crossed the Alps by the beginning of the fifteenth
century we know from the second entry. Nay, we learn more precise
details. We learn that our manuscript had found a home in France, in the
town of Meaux or its vicinity. The entry is found in the upper margin of
fol. 51<sup>r</sup> and doubtless represents a <i>probatio pennae</i> on
the part of a notary. It runs thus:</p>

<p class = "inset1">
“A tous ceulz qui ces p<i>rese</i>ntes l<i>ett</i>res verront et
orront<br>
Jeh<i>an</i> de Sannemeres garde du scel de la provoste de<br>
Meaulx &amp; Francois Beloy clerc Jure de p<i>ar</i> le Roy<br>
nostre sire a ce faire Salut sachient tuit que p<i>ar</i>.”
</p>

<p>The above note is made in the regular French notarial hand of the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.<a name = "tagI_32" href =
"#noteI_32"><sup>32</sup></a> The formula of greeting with which the
document opens is in the precise form in which it occurs in numberless
charters of the period. All efforts to identify Jehan de Sannemeres,
keeper of the seal of the <i>provosté</i> of Meaux, and François Beloy,
sworn clerk in behalf of the King, have so far proved fruitless.<a name

Our manuscript, then, was written in Italy about the year 500. It is
quite possible that it had crossed the Alps by the ninth century or even
before. It is certain that by the fifteenth century it had found asylum
in France. When and under what circumstances it got back to Italy will
be shown by Professor Rand in the pages that follow.</p>

<p>So it is France that has saved this, the oldest extant witness of
Pliny’s <i>Letters</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<a name = "page_22"> </a>
for modern times. To mediaeval France we are, in fact, indebted for the
preservation of more than one ancient classical manuscript. The oldest
manuscript of the third decade of Livy was at Corbie in Charlemagne’s
time, when it was loaned to Tours and a copy of it made there. Both copy
and original have come down to us. Sallust’s <i>Histories</i> were saved
(though not in complete form) for our generation by the Abbey of Fleury.
The famous Schedae Vergilianae, in square capitals, as well as the Codex
Romanus of Virgil, in rustic capitals, belonged to the monastery of St.
Denis. Lyons preserved the <i>Codex Theodosianus</i>. It was again some
French centre that rescued Pomponius Mela from destruction. The oldest
fragments of Ovid’s <i>Pontica</i>, the oldest fragments of the first
decade of Livy, the oldest manuscript of Pliny’s <i>Natural
History</i>&mdash;all palimpsests&mdash;were in some French centre in
the Middle Ages, as may be seen from the indisputably eighth-century
French writing which covers the ancient texts. The student of Latin
literature knows that the manuscript tradition of Lucretius, Suetonius,
Cæsar, Catullus, Tibullus, and Propertius&mdash;to mention only the
greatest names&mdash;shows that we are indebted primarily to Gallia
Christiana for the preservation of these authors.</p>

For example, in the fifth-century manuscript of Livy in Paris (MS. lat.
5730) the forty-third and forty-fifth quires are composed of six leaves,
while the rest are all quires of eight.

In an examination of all the uncial manuscripts in the Bibliothèque
Nationale of Paris, it was found that out of twenty manuscripts that may
be ascribed to the fifth and sixth centuries only two had the hair side
on the outside of the quires. Out of thirty written approximately
between A.D. 600 and 800, about half showed the same practice, the other
half having the hair side outside. Thus the practice of our oldest Latin
scribes agrees with that of the Greek:
see C.&nbsp;R. Gregory, “Les cahiers
des manuscrits grecs” in <i>Comptes Rendus de l’Academie des
Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres</i> (1885), p. 261. I am informed by
Professor Hyvernat, of the Catholic University of Washington, that the
same custom is observed by Coptic scribes.

The confused arrangement of the indices for Books I and II in the Codex
Bellovacensis may well have been found in the manuscript of which the
Morgan fragment is a part. The space required for the indices, however,
would not have greatly differed from that taken by the index of Book III
in both the Morgan fragment and the Codex Bellovacensis.

Many of our oldest Latin manuscripts have two and even three columns on
a page, a practice evidently taken over from the roll. But very ancient
manuscripts are not wanting which are written in long lines,

This is an ear-mark of great antiquity. It is found, for example, in the
Berlin and Vatican Schedae Vergilianae in square capitals (Berlin lat.
2<sup>o</sup> 416 and Rome Vatic. lat. 3256 reproduced in Zangemeister
and Wattenbach’s <i>Exempla Codicum Latinorum</i>, etc., pl. 14, and in
Steffens, <i>Lateinische Paläographie</i><sup>2</sup>, pl. 12b), in the
Vienna, Paris, and Lateran manuscripts of Livy, in the Codex Corbeiensis
of the Gospels, and here and there in the palimpsest manuscript of
Cicero’s <i>De Re Publica</i> and in other manuscripts.

In many of our oldest manuscripts uncials are employed. The Pliny
palimpsest of St. Paul in Carinthia agrees with our manuscript in using
rustic capitals. For facsimiles see J. Sillig, <i>C. Plini Secundi
Naturalis Historiae</i>, Libri XXXVI, Vol. VI, Gotha 1855, and
Chatelain, <i>Paléographie des Classiques Latins</i>, pl. CXXXVI.

<a name = "noteI_7" href = "#tagI_7">7.</a>
In this respect, too, the Pliny palimpsest of St. Paul in Carinthia
agrees with our fragment. Most of the oldest manuscripts, however, have
the colophon in the same type of writing as the text.
</div>

<div class = "footnote">
<a name = "noteI_8" href = "#tagI_8">8.</a>
This is also the case in the Paris manuscript of Livy of the fifth
century, in the Codex Bezae of the Gospels (published in facsimile by
the University of Cambridge in 1899), in the Pliny palimpsest of St.
Paul in Carinthia, and in many other manuscripts of the oldest type.

The strokes over the two consecutive <i>i</i>’s on fol. 53<sup>v</sup>,
l. 23, were made by a hand that can hardly be older than the thirteenth
century.

This doubtless stands for <i>Quaere</i> (=&nbsp;“investigate”), a
frequent marginal note in manuscripts of all ages. A number of instances
of <i>Q</i> for <i>quaere</i> are given by A.&nbsp;C. Clark,
<i>The Descent of Manuscripts</i>, Oxford 1918, p. 35.

Such a division as <i>ut</i>|<i>or</i> on fol. 7, l. 10, is due entirely
to thoughtless copying. The scribe probably took <i>ut</i> for a word.

That is, manuscripts written before the eighth century. The number of
abbreviations increases considerably during the eighth century.
Previously the only symbols found in calligraphic majuscule manuscripts
are the “Nomina Sacra” (<i>deus</i>, <i>dominus</i>, <i>Iesus</i>,
<i>Christus</i>, <i>spiritus</i>, <i>sanctus</i>), which constantly
occur in Christian literature, and such suspensions as are met with in
our fragment. A familiar exception is the manuscript of Gaius, preserved
in the Chapter library of Verona, MS. xv (13). This is full of
abbreviations not found in contemporary manuscripts containing purely
literary or religious texts. Cf. W. Studemund, <i>Gaii Institutionum
Commentarii Quattuor</i>, etc., Leipsic 1874; and F. Steffens,
<i>Lateinische Paläographie<sup>2</sup></i>, pl. 18 (pl. 8 of the
Supplement). The Oxyrhynchus papyrus of Cicero’s speeches is
non-calligraphic and therefore not subject to the rule governing
calligraphic products. The same is true of marginal notes to
calligraphic texts. See W.&nbsp;M. Lindsay, <i>Notae Latinae</i>,
Cambridge 1915, pp. 1-2.

<div class = "footnote">

This is a sign of antiquity. After the sixth century the <i>M</i> or
<i>N</i>stroke is usually placed above the vowel. The practice of
confining the omission of <i>M</i> or <i>N</i> to the end of a line is a
characteristic of our very oldest manuscripts. Later manuscripts omit
<i>M</i> or <i>N</i> in the middle of a line and in the middle of a
word. No distinction is made in our manuscript between omitted <i>M</i>
and omitted <i>N</i>. Some ancient manuscripts make a distinction. Cf.
Traube, <i>Nomina Sacra</i>, pp. 179, 181, 183, 185, final column of
each page; and W.&nbsp;M. Lindsay, <i>Notae Latinae</i>,
pp. 342 and 345.

masterly fashion by Ludwig Traube in his “Palaeographische Forschungen

That the hair side of the vellum retained the ink better than the flesh
side may be seen from an examination of facsimiles in the Leyden series
<i>Codices graeci et latini photographice depicti</i>.

That the ink could scale off the flesh side of the vellum in less than
three centuries is proved by the condition of the famous Tacitus
manuscript in Beneventan script in the Laurentian Library. It was
written in the eleventh century and shows retouched characters of the
thirteenth. See foll. 102, 103 in the facsimile edition in the Leyden
series mentioned in the previous note.

For the pertinent literature on the manuscripts in the following list
the student is referred to Traube’s <i>Vorlesungen und Abhandlungen</i>,
Vol. I, pp. 171-261, Munich 1909, and the index in Vol. III, Munich
1920. The chief works of facsimiles referred to below are: Zangemeister
and Wattenbach, <i>Exempla codicum latinorum litteris maiusculis
scriptorum</i>, Heidelberg 1876 &amp; 1879; E. Chatelain,
<i>Paléographie des classiques latins</i>, Paris 1884-1900, and
<i>Uncialis scriptura codicum latinorum novis exemplis illustrata</i>,
Paris 1901-2; and Steffens, <i>Lateinische <ins class = "correction"

LDUS MANUTIUS, in the preface to his edition of Pliny’s <i>Letters</i>,
printed at Venice in 1508, expresses his gratitude to Aloisio Mocenigo,
Venetian ambassador in Paris, for bringing to Italy an exceptionally
fine manuscript of the <i>Letters</i>; the book had been found not long
before at or near Paris by the architect Fra Giocondo of Verona. The
<i>editio princeps</i>, 1471, was based on a family of manuscripts that
omitted Book VIII, called Book IX Book VIII, and did not contain Book X,
the correspondence between Pliny and Trajan. Subsequent editions had
only in part made good these deficiencies. More than a half of Book X,
containing the letters numbered 41-121 in editions of our day, was
published by Avantius in 1502 from a copy of the Paris manuscript made
by Petrus Leander.<a name = "tagII_2" href =
"#noteII_2"><sup>2</sup></a> Aldus himself, two years before printing
his edition, had received from Fra Giocondo a copy of the entire
manuscript, with six other volumes, some of them printed editions which
Giocondo had collated with manuscripts. Aldus, addressing Mocenigo, thus
describes his acquisition:</p>

<p class = "inset1">
“Deinde Iucundo Veronensi Viro singulari ingenio, ac bonarum literarum
studiosissimo, quod et easdem Secundi epistolas ab eo ipso exemplari a
se descriptas in Gallia diligenter ut facit omnia, et sex alia uolumina
epistolarum partim manu scripta, partim impressa quidem, sed cum
antiquis collata exemplaribus, ad me ipse sua sponte, quae ipsius est
ergo studiosos omneis beneuolentia, adportauerit, idque biennio ante,
quam tu ipsum mihi exemplar publicandum tradidisses.”</p>

<p>So now the ancient manuscript itself had come. Aldus emphasizes its
value in supplying the defects of previous editions. The <i>Letters</i>
will now include, he declares:</p>

<p class = "inset1">
“multae non ante impressae. Tum Graeca correcta, et suis locis
restituta, atque retectis adulterinis, uera reposita. Item fragmentatae
epistolae, integrae factae. In medio etiam epistolae libri octaui de
Clitumno fonte non solum uertici calx additus, et calci uertex, sed
decem quoque epistolae interpositae, ac ex Nono libro Octauus factus, et
ex Octauo Nonus, Idque beneficio exemplaris correctissimi, &amp; mirae,
ac uenerandae Vetustatis.”</p>

<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
<a name = "page_38"> </a>
<p>The presence of such a manuscript, “most correct, and of a marvellous
and venerable antiquity,” stimulates the imagination: Aldus thinks that
now even the lost Decades of Livy may appear again:</p>

<p class = "inset1">
“Solebam superioribus Annis Aloisi Vir Clariss. cum aut T. Liuii
Decades, quae non extare creduntur, aut Sallustii, aut Trogi historiae,
aut quemuis alium ex antiquis autoribus inuentum esse audiebam, nugas
dicere, ac fabulas. Sed ex quo tu ex Gallia has Plinii epistolas in
Italia reportasti, in membrana scriptas, atque adeo diuersis a nostris
characteribus, ut nisi quis diu assuerit, non queat legere, coepi
sperare mirum in modum, fore aetate nostra, ut plurimi ex bonis
autoribus, quos non extare credimus, inueniantur.”</p>

<p>There was something unusual in the character of the script that made
it hard to read; its ancient appearance even suggested to Aldus a date
as early as that of Pliny himself.</p>

<p class = "inset1">
“Est enim uolumen ipsum non solum correctissimum, sed etiam ita
antiquum, ut putem scriptum Plinii temporibus.”</p>

<p>This is enthusiastic language. In the days of Italian humanism, a
scholar might call almost any book a <i>codex pervetustus</i> if it
supplied new readings for his edition and its script seemed unusual. As
Professor Merrill remarks:<a name = "tagII_3" href =
"#noteII_3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p class = "inset1">
“The extreme age that Aldus was disposed to attribute to the manuscript
will, of course, occasion no wonder in the minds of those who are
familiar with the vague notions on such matters that prevailed among
scholars before the study of palaeography had been developed into
somewhat of a science. The manuscript may have been written in one of
the so-called ‘national’ hands, Lombardic, Visigothic, or Merovingian.
But if it were in a ‘Gothic’ hand of the twelfth or thirteenth
centuries, it might have appeared sufficiently grotesque and illegible
to a reader accustomed for the most part to the exceedingly clear
Italian book hands of the fifteenth century.”</p>

<p>In a later article Professor Merrill well adds that even the uncial
script would have seemed difficult and alien to one accustomed to the
current fifteenth-century style.<a name = "tagII_4" href =
"#noteII_4"><sup>4</sup></a> A contemporary and rival editor, Catanaeus,
disputed Aldus’s claims. In his second edition of the <i>Letters</i>
(1518), he professed to have used a very ancient book that came down
from Germany and declared that the Paris manuscript had no right to the
antiquity which Aldus had imputed to it. But Catanaeus has been proved a
liar.<a name = "tagII_5" href = "#noteII_5"><sup>5</sup></a> He had no
ancient manuscript from Germany, and abused Aldus mainly to conceal his
cribbings from that scholar’s edition; we may discount his opinion of
the age of the Parisinus. Until Aldus, an eminent scholar and honest
publisher,<a name = "tagII_6" href = "#noteII_6"><sup>6</sup></a> is
proved guilty, we should assume him innocent of mendacity or naïve
ignorance. He speaks in earnest; his words ring true. We must be
prepared for the possibility that his ancient manuscript was really
ancient.</p>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
<a name = "page_39"> </a>
Since Aldus’s time the Parisinus has disappeared. To quote Merrill
again:<a name = "tagII_7" href = "#noteII_7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p class = "inset1">
“This wonderful manuscript, like so many others, appears to have
vanished from earth. Early editors saw no especial reason for preserving
what was to them but copy for their own better printed texts. Possibly
some leaves of it may be lying hid in old bindings; possibly they went
to cover preserve-jars, or tennis-racquets; possibly into some final
dust-heap. At any rate the manuscript is gone; the copy by Iucundus is
gone; the copy of the correspondence with Trajan that Avantius owed to
Petrus Leander is gone; if others had any other copies of Book X, in
whole or in part, they are gone too.”</p>

<a name = "paris_2">The Bodleian volume</a>
</span>
In 1708 Thomas Hearne, the antiquary, bought at auction a peculiar
volume of Pliny’s <i>Letters</i>. It consisted of Beroaldus’s edition of
the nine books (1498), the portions of Book X published by Avantius in
1502, and, on inserted leaves, the missing letters of Books VIII and
X.<a name = "tagII_8" href = "#noteII_8"><sup>8</sup></a> The printed
portions, moreover, were provided with over five hundred variant
readings and lemmata in a different hand from that which appeared on the
inserted leaves; the hand that added the variants also wrote in the
margin the sixteenth letter of Book IX, which is not in the edition of
Beroaldus. Hearne recognized the importance of this supplementary
matter, for he copied the variants into his own edition of the
<i>Letters</i> (1703), intending, apparently, to use them in a larger
edition which he is said to have published in 1709; he also lent the
book to Jean Masson, who refers to it in his <i>Plinii Vita</i>. Upon
Hearne’s death, this valuable volume was acquired by the Bodleian
Library in Oxford, but lay unnoticed until Mr. E.&nbsp;G. Hardy,
in 1888,<a name = "tagII_9" href = "#noteII_9"><sup>9</sup></a>
examined it and,
after a comparison of the readings, pronounced it the very copy from
which Aldus had printed his edition in 1508. External proof of this
highly exciting surmise seemed to appear in a manuscript note on the
last page of the edition of Avantius, written in the hand that had
inserted the variants and supplements throughout the volume:<a name =
"tagII_10" href = "#noteII_10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p class = "inset1">
“hae plinii iunioris epistolae ex uetustissimo exemplari parisiensi et
restitutae et emendatae sunt opera et industria ioannis iucundi
prestantissimi architecti hominis imprimis antiquarii.”</p>

<p>What more natural to conclude than that here is the very copy that
Aldus prepared from the ancient manuscript and the collations and
transcripts sent him by Fra Giocondo? One fact blocks this attractive
conjecture: though there are many agreements between the readings of the
emended Bodleian book and those of Aldus, there are also many
disagreements. Mr. Hardy removed the obstacle by assuming that Aldus
made changes in the proof; but the changes are numerous; they are not
too numerous for a scholar who can mark up his galleys free of cost, but
they are decidedly too numerous if the scholar is also his own
printer.</p>

<p>
<span class = "pagenum">40</span>
<a name = "page_40"> </a>
Merrill, in a brilliant and searching article,<a name = "tagII_11" href
= "#noteII_11"><sup>11</sup></a> entirely demolishes Hardy’s argument.
Unlike most destructive critics, he replaces the exploded theory by
still more interesting fact. For the rediscovery of the Bodleian book
and a proper appreciation of its value, students of Pliny’s text must
always be grateful to Hardy; we now know, however, that the volume was
never owned by Aldus. The scholar who put its parts together and added
the variants with his own hand was the famous Hellenist Guillaume Budé
(Budaeus). The parts on the supplementary leaves were done by some
copyist who imitated the general effect of the type used in the book
itself; Budaeus added his notes on these inserted leaves in the same way
as elsewhere. It had been shown before by Keil<a name = "tagII_12" href
= "#noteII_12"><sup>12</sup></a> that Budaeus must have used the
readings of the Parisinus; indeed, it is from his own statement in
<i>Annotationes in Pandectas</i> that we learn of the discovery of the
ancient manuscript by Giocondo:<a name = "tagII_13" href =
"#noteII_13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p class = "inset1">
“Verum haec epistola et aliae non paucae in codicibus impressis non
leguntur: nos integrum ferme Plinium habemus: primum apud parrhisios
repertum opera Iucundi sacerdotis: hominis antiquarii Architectique
famigerati.”</p>

<p>The wording here is much like that in the note at the end of the
Bodleian book. After establishing his case convincingly from the
readings followed by Budaeus in his quotations from the <i>Letters</i>,
Merrill eventually was able to compare the handwriting with the
acknowledged script of Budaeus and to find that the two are identical.<a
name = "tagII_14" href = "#noteII_14"><sup>14</sup></a> The Bodleian
book, then, is not Aldus’s copy for the printer. It is Budaeus’s own
collation from the Parisinus. Whether he examined the manuscript
directly or used a copy made by Giocondo is doubtful; the note at the
end of the Bodleian volume seems to favor the latter possibility.
Budaeus does not by any means give a complete collation, but what he
does give constitutes, in Merrill’s opinion, our best authority for any
part of the lost Parisinus.<a name = "tagII_15" href =

Perhaps we may now say the Bodleian volume <i>has been hitherto</i> our
best authority. For a fragment of the ancient book, if my conjecture is
right, is now, after various journeys, reposing in the Pierpont Morgan
Library in New York City.</p>


<p class = "section">
First of all, we are impressed with the script. It is an uncial of about
the year 500 A.D.&mdash;certainly <i>venerandae vetustatis</i>. If Aldus
had this same uncial codex at his disposal, we can understand his
delight and pardon his slight exaggeration, for it is only slight. The
essential truth of his statement remains: he had found a book of a
different class from that of the ordinary manuscript&mdash;indeed
<i>diversis a nostris characteribus</i>. Instead of thinking him arrant
knave or fool enough to
<span class = "pagenum">41</span>
<a name = "page_41"> </a>
bring down “antiquity” to the thirteenth century, we might charitably
push back his definition of “<i>nostri characteres</i>” to include
anything in minuscules; script “not our own” would be the majuscule
hands in vogue before the Middle Ages. That is a position
palaeographically defensible, seeing that the humanistic script is a
lineal descendant of the Caroline variety. Furthermore, an uncial hand,
though clear and regular as in our fragment, is harder to read than a
glance at a page of it promises. This is due to the writing of words
continuously. It takes practice, as Aldus says, to decipher such a
script quickly and accurately. Moreover, the flesh sides of the leaves
are faded.</p>


<p class = "section">
<span class = "sidenote">
<a name = "paris_5">Provenience and contents</a>
</span>
We next note that the fragment came to the Pierpont Morgan Library from
Aldus’s country, where, as Dr. Lowe has amply shown, it was written; how
it came into the possession of the Marquis Taccone would be interesting
to know. But, like the Parisinus, the book to which our fragment
belonged had not stayed in Italy always. It had made a trip to
France&mdash;and was resting there in the fifteenth century, as is
proved by the French note of that period on fol. 51<sup>r</sup>. We may
say “the book” and not merely “the present six leaves,” for the fragment
begins with fol. 48, and the foliation is of the fifteenth century. The
last page of our fragment is bright and clear, showing no signs of wear,
as it would if no more had followed it;<a name = "tagII_16" href =
"#noteII_16"><sup>16</sup></a> I will postpone the question of what
probably did follow. Moreover, if the <i>probatio pennae</i> on
fol.53<sup>r</sup> is Carolingian,<a name = "tagII_17" href =
"#noteII_17"><sup>17</sup></a> it would appear that the book had been in
France at the beginning as well as at the end of the Middle Ages. Thus
our manuscript may well have been one of those brought up from Italy by
the emissaries of Charlemagne or their successors during the revival of
learning in the eighth and ninth centuries. The outer history of our
book, then, and the character of its script, comport with what we know
of Aldus’s Parisinus.</p>


<p class = "section">
<span class = "sidenote">
<a name = "paris_6">The text closely related to that of Aldus</a>
</span>
But we must now subject our fragment to internal tests. If Aldus used
the entire manuscript of which this is a part, his text must show a
general conformity to that of the fragment. An examination of the
appended collation will establish this fact beyond a doubt. The
references are to Keil’s critical edition of 1870, but the readings are
verified from Merrill’s apparatus. I will designate the fragment as
<i>Π</i>, using <i>P</i> for Aldus’s Parisinus and <i>a</i> for his
edition.</p>

<p>We may begin by excluding two probable misprints in Aldus, 64, 1
<i>contu</i>r<i>bernium</i> and 65, 17 <i>sub</i>e<i>uertas</i>. Then
there are various spellings in which Aldus adheres to the fashion of his
day, as <i>se</i>x<i>centies</i>, <i>mi</i>ll<i>ies</i>,
<i>mi</i>ll<i>ia</i>, <i>te</i>n<i>tarunt</i>, <i>cau</i>ss<i>as</i>,
<i>au</i>t<i>oritas</i>, <i>qua</i>n<i>quam</i>, <i>s</i>y<i>derum</i>,

<i>ad</i>u<i>lescet</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">42</span>
<a name = "page_42"> </a>
<i>e</i>x<i>oluit</i>, <i></i>Th<i>uscos</i>; there are other spellings
which modern editors might not disdain, <i>i.e.</i>,
<i>aerar</i>ii<i></i> and <i>i</i>ll<i>ustri</i>, and some that they
have accepted, namely <i>a</i>pp<i>onitur</i>, <i>e</i>x<i>istat</i>,
<i>i</i>m<i>pleturus</i>, <i>i</i>m<i>plorantes</i>,
<i>o</i>b<i>tulissem</i>, <i>bal</i>i<i>nei</i>, <i></i>c<i>aret</i>
(not <i></i>k<i>aret</i>), <i></i>c<i>aritas</i> (not
<i></i>k<i>aritas</i>).<a name = "tagII_18" href =
"#noteII_18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>A study of our collation will also show some forty cases of
correction in <i>Π</i> by either the scribe himself or a second and
possibly a third ancient hand. Here Aldus, if he read the pages of our
fragment and read them with care, might have seen warrant for following
either the original text or the emended form, as he preferred. The most
important cases are:61, 14 sera] <i>Πa</i> <span class =
"smallcaps">serua</span> <i>Π<sup>2</sup></i> 61, 21 considit] <i>Π</i>
<span class = "smallcaps">considet</span> <i>Π<sup>2</sup>a</i>. The
original reading of <i>Π</i> is clearly <span class =
"smallcaps">considit</span>. The second <span class =
"smallcaps">i</span> has been altered to a capital <span class =
"smallcaps">e</span>, which of course is not the proper form for uncial.
62, 5 residit] <i>Π</i> residet <i>a</i>. Here <i>Π</i> is not
corrected, but Aldus may have thought that the preceding case of <span
class = "smallcaps">considet</span> (<i>m. 2</i>) supported what he
supposed the better form <i>residet</i>. 63, 11 posset] <i>a</i> <span
class = "smallcaps">possit</span> (in <i>posset m. 1</i>?) <i>Π</i>.
Again the corrected <span class = "smallcaps">e</span> is capital, not
uncial, but Aldus would have had no hesitation in adopting the reading
of the second hand. 64, 2 modica vel etiam] <i>a</i> <span class =
"smallcaps">modica est etiam</span> (<i>corr. m. 2</i>) <i>Π</i>. 64, 28
excurrissem accepto, ut praefectus aerari, commeatu] <i>a</i>. Here
<i>Π</i> omitted <i>accepto ut praefectus aerari</i>,&mdash;evidently a
line of the manuscript that he was copying, for there are no similar
endings to account otherwise for the omission. 66, 2 dissentientis] <i>a

ex</i> <span class = "smallcaps">dissitientis</span> <i>m. 1</i> (?)
<i>Π</i>.</p>

<p>There are also a few careless errors of the first hand, uncorrected,
in <i>Π</i>, which Aldus himself might easily have corrected or have
found the right reading already in the early editions. 62, 23 conteror
quorum] <i>a</i> <span class = "smallcaps">conteror qui horum</span>
<i>Π B F</i> 63, 28 si] <i>a</i> <span class = "smallcaps">sibi</span>
<i>Π</i> 64, 24 conprobasse] <span class =
"smallcaps">comprouasse</span> <i>Π</i>.</p>

<p>In view of these certain errors of the first hand of <i>Π</i>, most
of them corrected but a few not, Aldus may have felt justified in
abiding by one of the early editions in the following three cases, where
<i>Π</i> might well have seemed to him wrong; in
<span class = "pagenum">43</span>
<a name = "page_43"> </a>
one of them (64,3) modern editors agree with him: 62, 20 aurium
oculorum vigor] Π aurium oculorumque uigor <i>a</i> 64, 3 proferenda]
<i>a</i> <span class = "smallcaps">conferanda</span> Π 65, 11 et alii] Π
etiam alii <i>a</i>.</p>

<p>There is only one case of possible emendation to note: 64, 29
questuri] Π quaesturi <i>MVa</i>. Aldus’s reading, as I learn from
Professor Merrill, is in the anonymous edition ascribed to Roscius
(Venice, 1492?), but not in any of the editions cited by Keil. This may
be a conscious emendation, but it is just as possibly an error of
hearing made by either Aldus or his compositor in repeating the word to
himself as he wrote or set up the passage. Once in the text,
<i>quaesturi</i> gives no offense, and is not corrected by Aldus in his
edition of 1518. An apparently more certain effort at emendation is
reported by Keil on 62, 13, where Aldus is said to differ from all the
manuscripts and the editions in reading <i>agere</i> for <i>facere</i>.
So he does in his second edition; but here he has <i>facere</i> with
everybody else. The changes in the second edition are few and are
largely confined to the correction of obvious misprints. There is no
point in substituting <i>agere</i> for <i>facere</i>. I should attribute
this innovation to a careless compositor, who tried to memorize too
large a bit of text, rather than to an emending editor. At all events,
it has no bearing on our immediate concern.</p>

<p>The striking similarity, therefore, between Aldus’s text and that of
our fragment confirms our surmise that the latter may be a part of that
ancient manuscript which he professes to have used in his edition.
Whatever his procedure may have been, he has produced a text that
differs from Π only in certain spellings, in the correction, with the
help of existing editions, of three obvious errors of Π and of three of
its readings that to Aldus might well have seemed erroneous, in two
misprints, and in one reading which is possibly an emendation but which
may just as well be another misprint. Thus the internal evidence of the
text offers no contradiction of what the script and the history of the
manuscript have suggested. I can not claim to have established an
irrefutable conclusion, but the signs all point in one direction. I see
enough evidence to warrant a working hypothesis, which we may use
circumspectly as a clue, submit to further tests, and abandon in case
these tests yield evidence with which it can not be reconciled.</p>

Further, if we are justified in our assumption that Aldus used the
manuscript of which Π is a part, the fragment is instructive as to his
editorial methods. If he proceeded elsewhere as carefully as here, he
certainly did not perform his task with the high-handedness of the
traditional humanistic editor; rather, he treated his ancient witness
with respect, and abandoned it only when confronted with what seemed its
obvious mistakes. I will revert to this matter at a later stage of the
argument.</p>

UT, it will be asked, how do we know that Aldus used Π rather than some
other manuscript that had a very similar text and that happened to have
gone through the same travels? To answer this question we must examine
the relation of Π to the other extant manuscripts in the light of what
is known of the transmission of Pliny’s <i>Letters</i> in the Middle
Ages. A convenient summary is given by Merrill on the basis of his

<p class = "section">
<span class = "sidenote">
<a name = "other_1">Classes of the manuscripts</a>
</span>
Manuscripts of the <i>Letters</i> may be divided into three classes,
distinguished by the number of books that each contains.</p>

<p>Class I, the ten-book family, consists of <i>B</i> (Bellovacensis or
Riccardianus), now Ashburnhamensis, R 98 in the Laurentian Library in
Florence, its former home, whence it had been diverted on an interesting
pilgrimage by the noted book-thief Libri. This manuscript is attributed
to the tenth century by Merrill, and by Chatelain in his description of
the book. But Chatelain labels his facsimile page “<i>Saec.</i> IX.”<a
name = "tagII_20" href = "#noteII_20"><sup>20</sup></a> The latter seems
the more probable date. The free use of a flat-topped <i>a</i>, along
with the general appearance of the script, reminds me of the style in
vogue at Fleury and its environs about the middle of the ninth century.
A good specimen is accessible in a codex of St. Hilary on the Psalms
(Vaticanus Reginensis 95), written at Micy between 846 and 859, of which
a page is reproduced by Ehrle and Liebaert.<a name = "tagII_21" href =
"#noteII_21"><sup>21</sup></a> <i>F</i> (Florentinus), the other
important representative of this class, is also in the Laurentian
Library (S. Marco 284). The date assigned to it seems also too late. It
is apparently as early as the tenth century, and also has some of the
characteristics of the script of Fleury; it is French work, at any rate.
Keil’s suggestion<a name = "tagII_22" href =
"#noteII_22"><sup>22</sup></a> that it may be the book mentioned as

have been presented to the monastery by that time.<a name = "tagII_23"
href = "#noteII_23"><sup>23</sup></a> These two manuscripts agree in
containing, by the first hand, only Books I-V, vi (<i>F</i> having all

epistularum · libri · decem</span>, we may infer that some ancestor, if
not the immediate ancestor, of <i>B</i> and <i>F</i> had all ten
books.</p>

<p>In Class II the leading manuscript is another Laurentian codex
(Mediceus XLVII 36), which contains Books I-IX, xxvi, 8. It was written
in the ninth century, at Corvey, whence it was brought to Rome at the
beginning of the sixteenth century. It is part of a volume that also
once contained our only manuscript of the first part of the
<i>Annals</i> of Tacitus.<a name = "tagII_24" href =
"#noteII_24"><sup>24</sup></a> The other chief manuscript of this class
is <i>V</i> (Vaticanus Latinus 3864), which has Books I-IV. The script
has been variously estimated. I am inclined to the opinion that the book
was written somewhere near Tours, perhaps Fleury, in the earlier part of
the ninth century.<a name = "tagII_25" href =
"#noteII_25"><sup>25</sup></a> If Ullman is right in seeing a reference
to Pliny’s <i>Letters</i> in a notice in a mediaeval catalogue of
Corbie,<a name = "tagII_26" href = "#noteII_26"><sup>26</sup></a> it may
be that the codex is a Corbeiensis. But it is also possible that a
volume of the <i>Letters</i> at Corbie was twice copied, once at Corvey
(<i>M</i>) and once in the neighborhood of Tours (<i>V</i>). At any
rate, with the help of <i>V</i>, we may reach farther back than Corvey
and Germany for the origin of this class. There are likewise two
fragmentary texts, both of brief extent, Monacensis 14641 (olim
Emmeramensis) <i>saec.</i> IX, and Leidensis Vossianus 98 <i>saec.</i>
IX, the latter partly in Tironian notes. Merrill regards these as
bearing “testimony to the existence of the nine-book text in the same
geographical region,” namely Germany.<a name = "tagII_27" href =
"#noteII_27"><sup>27</sup></a> There they are to-day, in Germany and
Holland, but where they were written is another affair. The Munich
fragment is part of a composite
<span class = "pagenum">46</span>
<a name = "page_46"> </a>
volume of which it occupies only a page or two. The script is
continental, and may well be that of Regensburg, but it shows marked
traces of insular influence, English rather than Irish in character. The
work immediately preceding the fragment is in an insular hand, of the
kind practised at various continental monasteries, such as Fulda; there
are certain notes in the usual continental hand. Evidently the
manuscript deserves consideration in the history of the struggle between
the insular and the continental hands in Germany.<a name = "tagII_28"
href = "#noteII_28"><sup>28</sup></a> The script of the Leyden fragment,
on the other hand, so far as I can judge from a photograph, looks very
much like the mid-century Fleury variety with which I have associated
the Bellovacensis; there can hardly be doubt, at any rate, that De Vries
is correct in assigning it to France, where Voss obtained so many of his
manuscripts.<a name = "tagII_29" href = "#noteII_29"><sup>29</sup></a>
Except, therefore, for <i>M</i> and the Munich fragment, there is no
evidence furnished by the chief manuscripts which connects the tradition
of the <i>Letters</i> with Germany. The insular clue afforded by the
latter book deserves further attention, but I can not follow it here.
The question of the Parisinus aside, <i>B</i> and <i>F</i> of Class I
and <i>V</i> of Class II are sure signs that the propagation of the text
started from one or more centres&mdash;Fleury and Corbie seem the most
probable&mdash;in France.</p>

<p>The third class comprises manuscripts containing eight books, the
eighth being omitted and the ninth called the eighth. Representatives of
this class are all codices of the fifteenth century, though the class
has a more ancient basis than that, namely a lost manuscript of Verona.
This is best attested by <i>D</i>, a Dresden codex, while almost all
other manuscripts of this class descend from a free recension made by
Guarino and conflated with <i>F</i>; <i>o</i>, <i>u</i>, and <i>x</i>
are the representatives of this recension (<i>G</i>) that are reported
by Merrill. The relation of this third class to the second is
exceedingly close; indeed, it may be merely a branch of it.<a name =

<span class = "sidenote">
<a name = "other_2">The early editions</a>
</span>
As is often the case, the leading manuscript authorities are only
inadequately represented in the early editions. The Editio Princeps
(<i>p</i>) of 1471 was based on
<span class = "pagenum">47</span>
<a name = "page_47"> </a>
a manuscript of the Guarino recension. A Roman editor in 1474 added part
of Book VIII, putting it at the end and calling it Book IX; he acquired
this new material, along with various readings in the other books, from
some manuscript of Class II that may have come down from the north.
Three editors, called ς by Keil&mdash;Pomponius Laetus 1490, Beroaldus
1498, and Catanaeus 1506&mdash;took <i>r</i> as a basis; but Laetus had
another and a better representative of the same type of text as that
from which <i>r</i> had drawn, and he likewise made use of <i>V</i>.
With the help of these new sources the ς editors polished away a large
number of the gross blunders of <i>p</i> and <i>r</i>, and added a
sometimes unnecessary brilliance of emendation. Avantius’s edition of
part of Book X in 1502 was appropriated by Beroaldus in the same year
and by Catanaeus in 1506; these latter editors had no new sources at
their disposal. No wonder that the Parisinus seemed a godsend to Aldus.
The only known ancient manuscripts whose readings had been utilized in
the editions preceding his own were <i>F</i> and <i>V</i>, both
incomplete representatives of Classes I and II. The manuscripts
discovered by the Roman editor and Laetus were of great help at the
time, but we have no certain evidence of their age. <i>B</i> and
<i>M</i> were not accessible.<a name = "tagII_31" href =
"#noteII_31"><sup>31</sup></a> Now, besides the transcript of Giocondo
and his other six volumes, whatever these may have been, Aldus had the
ancient codex itself with all ten books complete. Everybody admits that
the Parisinus, as shown by the readings of Aldus, is clearly associated
with the manuscripts of Class I. Its contents corroborate the evidence
of the title in <i>B</i>, which indicates descent from some codex
containing ten books.</p>

</span>
Now nothing is plainer than that <i>Π</i> is a member of Class I, as it
agrees with <i>BF</i> in the following errors, or what are regarded by
Keil as errors. I consider the text of the <i>Letters</i> and not their
superscriptions. 60, 15 duplicia] <i>MVD</i> duplicata <i>ΠBFGa</i>; 61,
12 confusa adhuc] <i>MV</i> adhuc confusa <i>ΠBFGa</i>; 62, 6

extensive passage here); 65, 11 alii quidam minores sed tamen numeri]
<i>DG</i> alii quidam minores sed tam innumeri <i>MV</i> alii quidem

priore <i>ΠBFGa</i>; 65, 24 iam] <i>MVDG</i> <i>om. ΠBFa.</i></p>

<p>Tastes differ, and not all these eleven readings of Class I may be
errors. Kukula, in the most recent Teubner edition (1912), accepts three
of them (60, 15; 62, 6; 65, 15), and Merrill, in his forthcoming
edition, five (60, 15; 61, 12; 62, 6;
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
<a name = "page_48"> </a>
65, 12; 65, 15). Personally I could be reconciled to them all with the
exception of the very two which Aldus could not admit&mdash;62, 23 and
64, 3; in both places he had the early editions to fall back on.
However, I should concur with Merrill and Kukula in preferring the
reading of the other classes in 62, 16 and 65, 24. In 65, 11 I would
emend to <i>alii quidam minoris sed tamen numeri</i>; if this is the
right reading, <i>ΠBF</i> agree in the easy error of <i>quidem</i> for
<i>quidam</i>, and <i>MVD</i> in another easy error, <i>minores</i> for
<i>minoris</i>&mdash;the parent manuscript of <i>MV</i> further changed
<i>tamen numeri</i> to <i>tam innumeri</i>. Whatever the final judgment,
here are five cases in which all recent editors would attribute error to
Class I; in the remaining six cases the manuscripts of Class I either
agree in error or avoid the error of Class II&mdash;surely, then,
<i>Π</i> is not of the latter class. There are six other significant
errors of <i>MV</i> in the whole passage, no one of which appears in
<i>Π</i>: 61, 15 si non] sint <i>MV</i>; 62, 6 mira illis] mirabilis
<i>MV</i>; 62, 11 lotus] illic <i>MV</i>; cibum] cibos <i>MV</i>; 62,
25 fuit&mdash;64, 12 potes] <i>om. MV</i>; 66, 12 amatus] est amatus
<i>MV</i>. Once the first hand in <i>Π</i> agrees with <i>V</i> in an
error easily committed independently: 61, 12 ordinata] <span class =
"smallcaps">ordinata, di</span> ss. <i>m. 2</i> <i>Π</i> ornata
<i>V</i>.</p>

<p><i>Π</i>, then, and <i>MV</i> have descended from the archetype by
different routes. With Class III, the Verona branch of Class II,
<i>Π</i> clearly has no close association.</p>

<p>But the evidence for allying <i>Π</i> with <i>B</i> and <i>F</i>, the
manuscripts of Class I, is by no means exhausted. In 61, 14, <i>BFux</i>
have the erroneous emendation, which Budaeus includes among his
variants, of <i>serua</i> for <i>sera</i>. A glance at <i>Π</i> shows
its apparent origin. The first hand has <span class =
"smallcaps">sera</span> correctly; the second hand writes <span class =
"smallcaps">u</span> above the line.<a name = "tagII_32" href =
"#noteII_32"><sup>32</sup></a> If the second hand is solely responsible
for the attempt at improvement here, and is not reproducing a variant in
the parent manuscript of <i>Π</i>, then <i>BF</i> must descend directly
from <i>Π</i>. The following instances point in the same direction: 61,
21 considit] considet <i>BF</i>. <i>Π</i> has <span class =
"smallcaps">considit</span> by the first hand, the second hand changing
the second <span class = "smallcaps">i</span> to a capital <span class =
"smallcaps">e</span>.<a name = "tagII_33" href =
"#noteII_33"><sup>33</sup></a> In 65, 5, however, <span class =
"smallcaps">residit</span> is not thus changed in <i>Π</i>, and perhaps
for this very reason is retained by the careful scribe of <i>B</i>;
<i>F</i>, which has a slight tendency to emend, has, with <i>G</i>,
<i>residet</i>. 63, 9 praestat amat me] praestatam ad me <i>B</i>. Here
the letters of the <i>scriptura continua</i> in <i>Π</i> are faded and
blurred; the error of <i>B</i> would therefore be peculiarly easy if
this manuscript derived directly from <i>Π</i>. If one ask whether the
page were as faded in the ninth century as now, Dr. Lowe has already
answered this question; the flesh side of the parchment might well have
lost a portion of its ink considerably before the Carolingian period.<a
name = "tagII_34" href = "#noteII_34"><sup>34</sup></a> In any case, the
error of <i>praestatam ad me</i> seems natural enough to one who reads
the line for the first time in <i>Π</i>. <i>B</i> did not, as we shall
see, copy directly from <i>Π</i>; a copy intervened, in which the error
was made and then, I should infer, corrected above the line, whence
<i>F</i> drew the right reading, <i>B</i> taking the original but
incorrect text.</p>

<p><span class = "pagenum">49</span>
<a name = "page_49"> </a>
There are cases in plenty elsewhere in the <i>Letters</i> to show that
<i>B</i> is not many removes from the <i>scriptura continua</i> of some
majuscule hand. In the section included in <i>Π</i>, apart from the
general tightness of the writing, which led to the later insertion of
strokes between many of the words,<a name = "tagII_35" href =
"#noteII_35"><sup>35</sup></a> we note these special indications of a
parent manuscript in majuscules. In 61, 10 me autem], <i>B</i> started
to write <i>mea</i> and then corrected it. 64, 19 praeceptori a quo]
praeceptoria quo <i>B</i>, (<i>m. 1</i>) <i>F</i>. If <i>B</i> or its
parent manuscript copied <i>Π</i> directly, the mistake would be
especially easy, for <span class = "smallcaps">praeceptoria</span> ends
the line in <i>Π</i>. 64, 25 integra re]. After <i>integra</i>, a letter
is erased in <i>B</i>; the copyist, it would seem, first mistook
<i>integra re</i> for one word.</p>

<p>Other instances showing a close connection between <i>B</i> and
<i>Π</i> are as follows: 62, 23 unice] <i>Π</i> has by the first hand
<span class = "smallcaps">inuice</span>, the second hand writing <span
class = "smallcaps">u</span> above <span class = "smallcaps">i</span>,
and a vertical stroke above <span class = "smallcaps">u</span>. In
<i>BF</i>, <i>uince</i>, the reading of the first hand, is changed by
the second to <i>unice</i>; this second hand, Professor Merrill informs
me, seems to be that of a writer in the same scriptorium as the first.
The error in <i>BF</i> might, of course, be due to copying an original
in minuscules, but it might also be due to the curious state of affairs
in <i>Π</i>. 65, 24 fungerer]. In <i>Π</i> the final <span class =
"smallcaps">r</span> is written, somewhat indistinctly, above the line.
<i>B</i> has <i>fungerer</i> corrected by the second hand from
<i>fungeret</i> (?), which may be due to a misunderstanding of <i>Π</i>.
66, 2 avunculi] <span class = "smallcaps">auonculi</span> <i>Π</i>
(<span class = "smallcaps">o</span> <i>in ras.</i>) <i>B</i>. This form
might perhaps be read; <i>F</i> has emended it out, and no other
manuscript has it. 65, 7 desino, inquam, patres conscripti, putare].
Here the relation of <i>BF</i> to <i>Π</i> seems particularly close.
<i>Π</i>, like <i>MVDoxa</i>, has the abbreviation <span class =
"smallcaps">p.c.</span> On a clearly written page, the error of
<i>reputare</i> (<i>BF</i>) for <span class = "smallcaps">p.c.
putare</span> is not a specially likely one to make. But in the blur at
the bottom of fol. 52<sup>v</sup>, a page on the flesh side of the
parchment, the combination might readily be mistaken for <span class =
"smallcaps">reputare</span>.</p>

<p>Another curious bit of testimony appears at the beginning of the
third book. The scribe of <i>B</i><a name = "tagII_36" href =
"#noteII_36"><sup>36</sup></a> wrote the words <span class =
"smallcaps">nescio&mdash;apud</span> in rustic capitals, occupying
therewith the first line and about a third of the second. This is not
effective calligraphy. It would appear that he is reproducing, as is his
habit, exactly what he found in his original. That original might have
had one full line, or two lines, of majuscules, perhaps, following
pretty closely the lines in <i>Π</i>, which has the same amount of text,
plus the first three letters of <span class =
"smallcaps">spurinnam</span>, in the first two lines. If <i>B</i> had
<i>Π</i> before him, there is nothing to explain his most unusual
procedure. His original, therefore, is not <i>Π</i> but an intervening
copy, which he is transcribing with an utter indifference to aesthetic
effect and with a laudable, if painful, desire for accuracy. This trait,
obvious in <i>B</i>’s work throughout, is perhaps nowhere more
strikingly exhibited than here.</p>

<a name = "other_4">Π the direct ancestor of BF with probably a copy
intervening</a>
</span>
If <i>Π</i> is the direct ancestor of <i>BF</i>, these manuscripts
should contain no good readings not found in <i>Π</i>, unless their
writers could arrive at such readings by easy emendation or unless there
is contamination with some other source. From what we know of the text
of <i>BF</i> in general, the latter supposition may at once be ruled
out. There are but three cases to consider, two of which may be readily
disposed of: 64, 3 proferenda] conferenda <i>BF</i> <span class =
"smallcaps">conferanda</span> <i>Π</i>; 64, 4 conprobasse] (comp.)
<i>BF</i> <span class = "smallcaps">comprouasse</span> <i>Π</i>. These
are simple slips, which a scribe might almost unconsciously correct as
he wrote. The remaining error (63, 28 <span class =
"smallcaps">sibi</span> to <i>si</i>) is not difficult to emend when one
considers the entire sentence: <i>quibus omnibus ita demum similis
adolescet</i>, si <i>imbutus honestis artibus fuerit, quas</i>, etc. It
is less probable, however, that <i>B</i> with <i>Π</i> before him should
correct it as he wrote than, as we have already surmised, that a
minuscule copy intervened between <i>Π</i> and <i>B</i>, in which the
letters <i>bi</i> were deleted by some careful reviser. Two other
passages tend to confirm this assumption of an intermediate copy. In 65,
6 (<i>tum optime libertati venia obsequio praeparatur</i>), <i>B</i> has
<i>optimae</i>, a false alteration induced perhaps by the following
<i>libertati</i>. In <i>Π</i>, <span class = "smallcaps">optime</span>
stands at the end of the line. The scribe of <i>B</i>, had he not found
<i>libertati</i> immediately adjacent, would not so readily be tempted
to emend; still, we should not make too much of this instance, as
<i>B</i> has a rather pronounced tendency to write <i>ae</i> for
<i>e</i>. A more certain case is 66, 7 fungar indicis] fungarindicis
<i>ex</i> fungari dicis <i>B</i>; here the error is easier to derive
from an original in minuscules in which <i>in</i> was abbreviated with a
stroke above the <i>i</i>. There is abundant evidence elsewhere in the
<i>Letters</i> that the immediate ancestor of <i>BF</i> was written in
minuscules; I need not elaborate this point. Our present consideration
is that apart from the three instances of simple emendation just
discussed, there is no good reading of <i>B</i> or <i>F</i> in the
portion of text contained in <i>Π</i> that may not be found, by either
the first or the second hand, in <i>Π</i>.<a name = "tagII_37" href =
"#noteII_37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>We may now examine a most important bit of testimony to the close
connection existing between <i>BF</i> and <i>Π</i>. <i>B</i> alone of
all manuscripts hitherto known is provided with indices of the
<i>Letters</i>, one for each book, which give the names of the
correspondents and the opening words of each letter. Now <i>Π</i>, by
good luck, preserves the end of Book II, the beginning of Book III, and
between them the index for Book III. Dr. F.&nbsp;E. Robbins,
in a careful article on <i>B</i> and <i>F</i>, and one
<span class = "pagenum">51</span>
<a name = "page_51"> </a>
on the tables of contents in <i>B</i>,<a name = "tagII_38" href =
"#noteII_38"><sup>38</sup></a> concluded that <i>P</i> did not contain
the indices which are preserved in <i>B</i>, and that these were
compiled in some ancestor of <i>B</i>, perhaps in the eighth century.
Here they are, in the Morgan fragment, which takes us back two centuries
farther into the past. A comparison of the index in <i>Π</i> shows
indubitably a close kinship with <i>B</i>. A glance at plates
<a href = "images/plate13.jpg">XIII</a> and
<a href = "images/plate14.jpg">XIV</a> indicates,
first of all, that the copy <i>B</i>, here as in the text
of the <i>Letters</i>, is not many removes from <i>scriptura
continua</i>. Moreover, the lists are drawn up on the same principle;
the <i>nomen</i> and <i>cognomen</i> but not the <i>praenomen</i> of the
correspondent being given, and exactly the same amount of text quoted at
the beginning of each letter. The incipit of III, xvi (<span class =
"smallcaps">ad nepotem&mdash;adnotasse uideor fatadictaq·</span>) is an
addition in <i>Π</i>, and the lemma is longer than usual, as though the
original title had been omitted in the manuscript which <i>Π</i> was
copying and the corrector of <i>Π</i> had substituted a title of his own
making.<a name = "tagII_39" href = "#noteII_39"><sup>39</sup></a> It
reappears in <i>B</i>, with the easy emendation of <i>facta</i> from
<i>fata</i>. The only other case in the indices of a right reading in
<i>B</i> that is not in <i>Π</i> is in the title of III, viii: <span
class = "smallcaps">ad sueton tranque</span> <i>Π</i> Adsu&amp;on
tranqui. <i>B</i>. In both these instances the scribe of <i>B</i> needed
no external help in correcting the simple error. Far more significant is
the coincidence of <i>B</i> and <i>Π</i> in very curious mistakes, as
the address of III, iii (<span class = "smallcaps">ad caerelliae
hispullae</span> for <span class = "smallcaps">ad corelliam
hispullam</span>) and the lemma of III, viii (<span class =
"smallcaps">facis adprocetera</span> for <span class = "smallcaps">facis
pro cetera</span>). <i>ΠBF</i> agree in omitting <span class =
"smallcaps">suae</span> (III, iii) and <span class =
"smallcaps">suo</span> (III, iv), but in retaining the pronominal
adjectives in the other addresses preserved in <i>Π</i>. The same
unusual suspensions occur in <i>Π</i> and <i>B</i>, as <span class =
"smallcaps">ad sueton tranque</span> (tranqui <i>B</i>); <span class =
"smallcaps">ad uestric spurinn·</span>; <span class = "smallcaps">ad
silium procul</span>.<a name = "tagII_40" href =
"#noteII_40"><sup>40</sup></a> In the first of these cases, the parent
of <i>Π</i> evidently had <span class = "smallcaps">tranq·</span>, which
<i>Π</i> falsely enlarges to <span class = "smallcaps">tranque</span>;
this form and not <span class = "smallcaps">tranq·</span> is the basis
of <i>B</i>’s correction&mdash;a semi-successful correction&mdash;<span
class = "smallcaps">tranqui</span>. This, then, is another sign that
<i>B</i> depends directly on <i>Π</i>. Further, <i>B</i> omits one
symbol of abbreviation which <i>Π</i> has (<span class =
"smallcaps">possum iam perscri{-b}</span>), the lemma of the ninth
letter), and in the lemma of the tenth neither manuscript preserves the
symbol (<span class = "smallcaps">composuisse me quaed</span>). In the
first of these cases, it will be observed, <i>B</i> has a very long
<i>i</i> in <i>perscrib</i>.<a name = "tagII_41" href =
"#noteII_41"><sup>41</sup></a> This long <i>i</i> is not a feature of
the script of <i>B</i>, nor is there any provocation for it in the way
in which the word is written in <i>Π</i>. This detail, therefore, may be
added to the indications that a copy in minuscules intervened between
<i>B</i> and <i>Π</i>; the curious <i>i</i>, faithfully reproduced, as
usual, by <i>B</i>, may have occurred in such a copy.</p>

<p>These details prove an intimate relation between <i>Π</i> and
<i>BF</i>, and fit the supposition that <i>B</i> and <i>F</i> are direct
descendants of <i>Π</i>. This may be strengthened
<span class = "pagenum">52</span>
<a name = "page_52"> </a>
by another consideration. If <i>Π</i> and <i>B</i> independently copy
the same source, they inevitably make independent errors, however
careful their work. <i>Π</i> should contain, then, a certain number of
errors not in <i>B</i>. As we have found only three such cases in 12
pages, or 324 lines, and as in all these three the right reading in
<i>B</i> could readily have been due to emendation on the part of the
scribe of <i>B</i> or of a copy between <i>Π</i> and <i>B</i>, we have
acquired negative evidence of an impressive kind. It is distinctly
harder to believe that the two texts derive independently from a common
source. Show us the significant errors of <i>Π</i> not in <i>B</i>, and
we will accept the existence of that common source; otherwise the
appropriate supposition is that <i>B</i> descends directly from its
elder relative <i>Π</i>. It is not necessary to prove by an examination
of readings that <i>Π</i> is not copied from <i>B</i>; the dates of the
two scripts settle that matter at the start. Supposing, however, for the
moment, that <i>Π</i> and <i>B</i> were of the same age, we could
readily prove that the former is not copied from the latter. For
<i>B</i> contains a significant collection of errors which are not
present in <i>Π</i>. Six slight mistakes were made by the first hand and
corrected by it, three more were corrected by the second hand, and
twelve were left uncorrected. Some of these are trivial slips that a
scribe copying <i>B</i> might emend on his own initiative, or perhaps by
a lucky mistake. Such are 64, 26 iudicium] indicium <i>B</i>; 64, 29
Caecili] caecilii <i>B</i>; 65, 13 neglegere] neglere <i>B</i>. But
intelligent pondering must precede the emendation of <i>praeceptoria

(<i>praestatam ad me</i>) and 65,7 (<i>reputare</i> into <i>patres
conscripti putare</i>). These are the sort of errors which if found in
<i>Π</i> would furnish incontrovertible proof that a manuscript not
containing them was independent of <i>Π</i>; but there is no such
evidence of independence in the case of <i>B</i>. Our case is
strengthened by the consideration that various of the errors in <i>B</i>
may well be traced to idiosyncrasies of <i>Π</i>, not merely to its
<i>scriptura continua</i>, a source of misunderstanding that any
majuscule would present, but to the fading of the writing on the flesh
side of the pages in <i>Π</i>, and to the possibility that some of the
corrections of the second hand may be the private inventions of that
hand.<a name = "tagII_42" href = "#noteII_42"><sup>42</sup></a> We are
hampered, of course, by the comparatively small amount of matter in

<a name = "other_6">Further consideration of the external history
of P, Π, and B</a>
</span>
Still further evidence is supplied by the external history of our
manuscripts. <i>B</i> was at Beauvais at the end of the twelfth or the
beginning of the thirteenth century, as we have seen.<a name =
"tagII_43" href = "#noteII_43"><sup>43</sup></a> Whatever the
uncertainties as to its origin, any palaeographer would agree that it
could hardly have been written before the middle of the ninth century or
after the middle of the tenth. It was undoubtedly produced in France, as
was <i>F</i>, its sister manuscript. The presumption is that
<i>Π</i><sup>1</sup>, the copy intervening between <i>Π</i> and
<i>B</i>, was also French, and that <i>Π</i> was in France when the copy
was made from it. Merrill, for what reason I fail to see, suggested that
the original of <i>BF</i> might be “Lombardic,” written in North
Italy.<a name = "tagII_44" href = "#noteII_44"><sup>44</sup></a> An
extraneous origin of this sort must be proved from the character of the
errors, such as spellings and the false resolution of abbreviations,
made by <i>BF</i>. If no such signs can be adduced, it is natural to
suppose that <i>Π</i><sup>1</sup> was of the same nationality and
general tendencies as its copies <i>B</i> and <i>F</i>. This
consideration helps out the possible evidence furnished by the
scribbling in a hand of the Carolingian variety on fol.
53<sup>v</sup>;<a name = "tagII_45" href =
"#noteII_45"><sup>45</sup></a> we may now be more confident that it is
French rather than Italian. But whatever the history of our book in the
early Middle Ages, in the fifteenth century it was surely near Meaux,
which is not far from Paris&mdash;about as far to the east as Beauvais
is to the north. Now, granted for a moment that the last of our stemmata
is correct, <i>X</i>, from which <i>Π</i> and <i>B</i> descend, being
earlier than <i>Π</i>, must have been a manuscript in majuscules,
written in Italy, since that is unquestionably the provenience of
<i>Π</i>. There were, then, by this supposition, <i>two</i> ancient
majuscule manuscripts of the <i>Letters</i>, most closely related in
text&mdash;veritable twins, indeed&mdash;that travelled from Italy to
France. One (X<sup>1</sup>) had arrived in the early Middle Ages and is
the parent of
<span class = "pagenum">54</span>
<a name = "page_54"> </a>
<i>B</i> and <i>F</i>; the other (<i>Π</i>) was probably there in the
early Middle Ages, and surely was there in the fifteenth century. We can
not deny this possibility, but, on the principle <i>melius est per unum
fieri quam per plura</i>, we must not adopt it unless driven to it. The
history of the transmission of Classical texts in the Carolingian period
is against such a supposition.<a name = "tagII_46" href =
"#noteII_46"><sup>46</sup></a> Not many books of the age and quality of
<i>Π</i> were floating about in France in the ninth century. There is
nothing in the evidence presented by <i>Π</i> and <i>B</i> that drives
us to assume the presence of two such codices. There is nothing in this
evidence that does not fit the simpler supposition that <i>BF</i>
descend directly from <i>Π</i>. The burden of proof would appear to rest
on those who assert the contrary. <i>Π</i>, therefore, if the ancestor
of <i>B</i>, contained at least as much as we find today in <i>B</i>.
Some ancestor of <i>B</i> had all ten books. Aldus, whose text is
closely related to <i>BF</i>, got all ten books from a very ancient
manuscript that came down from Paris. Our simpler stemma indicates the
presence of one rather than more than one such manuscript in the
vicinity of Paris in the ninth or the tenth century and again in the
fifteenth. This line of argument, which presents not a mathematically
absolute demonstration but at least a highly probable concatenation of
facts and deductions, warrants the assumption, to be used at any rate as
a working hypothesis, that <i>Π</i> is a fragment of the lost Parisinus
which contained all the books of Pliny’s <i>Letters</i>.</p>

<a name = "other_7">Evidence from the portions of BF outside the text of
Π</a>
</span>
We may corroborate this reasoning by evidence drawn from the portions of
<i>BF</i> outside the text of <i>Π</i>. We note, above all, a number of
omissions in <i>BF</i> that indicate the length of line in some
manuscript from which they descend. This length of line is precisely
what we find in <i>Π</i>. Our fragment has lines containing from 23 to
33 letters, very rarely 23, 24, or 33, and most frequently from 27 to
30, the average being 28.4. These figures tally closely with those given
by Professor A.&nbsp;C. Clark<a name = "tagII_47" href =
"#noteII_47"><sup>47</sup></a> for the Vindobonensis of Livy, a codex
not far removed in
<span class = "pagenum">55</span>
<a name = "page_55"> </a>
date from <i>Π</i>. Supposing that <i>Π</i> is a typical section of
<i>P</i>&mdash;and after Professor Clark’s studies<a name = "tagII_48"
href = "#noteII_48"><sup>48</sup></a> we may more confidently assume
that it is&mdash;<i>P</i> had the same length of line. The important
cases of omission are as follows:</p>

<p>32, 19 atque etiam invisus virtutibus fuerat evasit, reliquit
incolumen optimum atque] etiam&mdash;atque <i>om. BF</i>. <i>P</i> would
have the abbreviation for <i>bus</i> in <i>virtutibus</i> and for
<i>que</i> in <i>atque</i>. There would thus be in all 61 letters and
dots, or two lines, arranged about as follows:</p>

<p>The scribe could easily catch at the second ATQ· after writing the
first. It will be at once objected that the repeated ATQ· might have
occasioned the mistake, whatever the length of the line. Thus in 82, 2
(aegrotabat Caecina Paetus, maritus eius, aegrotabat]
Caecina&mdash;aegrotabat <i>om. BF</i>), the omitted portion comprises
34 letters&mdash;a bit too long, perhaps, for a line of <i>P</i>. The
following instances, however, can not be thus disposed of.</p>

<p>94, 10 alia quamquam dignitate propemodum paria] quamquam&mdash;paria
(32 letters) <i>om. BF</i>. <i>Cetera</i> and <i>paria</i>, to be sure,
offer a mild case of <i>homoioteleuta</i>, but not powerful enough to
occasion an omission unless the words happened to stand at the ends of
lines, as they might well have done in <i>P</i>. As the line occurs near
the beginning of a letter, we may verify our conjecture by plotting the
opening lines. The address, as in <i>Π</i>, would occupy a line. Then,
allowing for contractions in <i>rebus</i> (18) and <i>quoque</i> (19)
and reading <i>cum</i> (Class I) for <i>quod</i> (18), <i>cetera</i>
(Class I) for <i>alia</i> (20), we can arrange the 236 letters in 8
lines, with an average of 29.5 letters in a line.</p>

responderunt quem prius: interrogati an tunc gratis adfuisset,

to similar endings, as <i>interrogati</i> and <i>responderunt</i> are
both repeated, but neither chance is taken by <i>BF</i>. Instead, a far
less striking case (<i>sentiebant&mdash;responderunt</i>) leads to the
omission. The arrangement in <i>P</i> might be</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">sentiebant</span> and <span class =

dangerous by their position at the end of lines; indeed, in the
<i>scriptura continua</i> the danger of confusing <i>homoioteleuta</i>,
unless these stand at the end of lines, is distinctly less than in a
script in which the words are divided. Here again, as in 94, 10, we may
reckon the lengths of the opening lines of the letter. After the line
occupied with the addresses, we have 296 letters, or ten lines with an
average of 29.6 letters apiece.

<p>We may add two omissions of <i>F</i> in passages now missing
altogether in <i>B</i>. 69, 28 quod minorem ex liberis duobus amisit
sed maiorem] minorem&mdash;sed <i>om.</i> <i>F</i>. Here again an
omission is imminent from the similar endings
<i>minorem&mdash;maiorem</i>; that made by <i>F</i> (29 letters and one
dot) seems to be that of a line of <i>P</i> where the arrangement would
be:</p>

<p>There may have been a copy (<i>P</i><sup>2</sup>) intervening between
<i>P</i><sup>1</sup> and <i>F</i>, but doubtless neither that nor
<i>P</i><sup>1</sup> itself had lines so short as those in <i>P</i>; the
error of <i>F</i>, therefore, may be most naturally ascribed to
<i>P</i><sup>1</sup>, who omitted a line of <i>P</i>.</p>

<p>130, 16 percolui. in summa (cur enim non aperiam tibi vel iudicium
meum vel errorem?) primum ego] in summa&mdash;primum (59 letters) <i>om.
F</i>. As there are no <i>homoioteleuta</i> here at all, we surely are
concerned with the omission of a line or lines. Perhaps 59 letters would
make up a line in <i>P</i><sup>1</sup> or <i>P</i><sup>2</sup>. Perhaps
two lines of <i>P</i> were dropped.</p>

<p>Similarly we may note two omissions in <i>B</i>, though not in
<i>F</i>, which may be due originally to the error of
<i>P</i><sup>1</sup> in copying <i>P</i>.</p>

<p>68, 5 electorumque commentarios centum sexaginta mihi reliquit,
opisthographos] -torumque&mdash;opisthographos <i>om. B</i>. Allowing
the abbreviation of <span class = "smallcaps">que</span>, we have 59
letters and one dot here. The omitted words are written by the first
hand of <i>B</i> at the foot of the page. Of course the omission may
correspond to a line of <i>P</i><sup>1</sup> dropped by <i>B</i> in
copying, but it is equally possible that <i>P</i><sup>1</sup> committed
the error and corrected it by the marginal supplement, <i>F</i> noting
the correction in time to include the omitted words in his text,
<i>B</i> copying them in the margin as he found them in
<i>P</i><sup>1</sup>.</p>

<p>87, 12 tacitus suffragiis impudentia inrepat. nam quoto cuique eadem
honestatis] suffragiis&mdash;honestatis <i>om. m. 1, add. in mg. m.
2</i> <i>B</i> (54 letters, with <span class = "smallcaps">que</span>
abbreviated). This may be like the preceding, except that the correction
was done not by the original scribe of <i>B</i>, but by a scribe in the
same monastery. The presence of <i>homoioteleuta</i>, we must admit,
adds an element of uncertainty.</p>

<p>So, of the passages here brought forward, 94, 20; 123, 10 and 69, 28
are best explained by supposing that <i>B</i> and <i>F</i> descend from
a manuscript that like <i>Π</i> had
<span class = "pagenum">57</span>
<a name = "page_57"> </a>
from 24 to 32 letters in a line, while 32, 19 and 130, 16 fit this
supposition as well as they do any other.</p>

<p>One orthographic peculiarity is perhaps worth noting: we saw that
<i>B</i> did not agree with <i>Π</i> in the spellings <i>karet</i> and
<i>karitas</i>.<a name = "tagII_49" href =
"#noteII_49"><sup>49</sup></a> We do, however, find <i>karitate</i>
elsewhere in <i>B</i> (109, 8), and the curious reading
<i>Kl</i>∴<i>facere</i>, mg. <i>calfacere</i>, for <i>calfacere</i> (56,
12). This is an additional bit of evidence for supposing that a copy
(<i>P</i><sup>1</sup>) intervened between <i>P</i> and <i>B</i>;
<i>P</i> had the spelling <i>Karitas</i> consistently,
<i>P</i><sup>1</sup> altered it to the usual form, and <i>B</i>
reproduced the corrections in <i>P</i><sup>1</sup>, failing to take them
all, unless, as may well be, <i>P</i><sup>1</sup> had failed to correct
all the cases.</p>

<p>Thus the evidence contained in the portion of <i>BF</i> outside the
text of <i>Π</i> corroborates our working hypothesis deduced from the
fragment itself. We have found nothing yet to overthrow our surmise that
a bit of the ancient Parisinus is veritably in the city of New York.</p>

<a name = "aldus_1">Aldus’s methods; his basic text</a>
</span>
<span class = "textletter">W</span>
E may now return to Aldus and imagine, if we can, his method of critical
procedure. Finding his agreement with <i>Π</i> so close, even in what
editors before and after him have regarded as errors, I am disposed to
think that he studied his Parisinus with care and followed its authority
respectfully. Finding that his seemingly extravagant statements about
the antiquity of his book are essentially true, I am disposed to put
more confidence in Aldus than editors have granted him thus far. I
should suppose that, working in the most convenient way, he turned over
to his compositor, not a fresh copy of <i>P</i>, but the pages of some
edition corrected from <i>P</i>&mdash;which Aldus surely tells us that
he used&mdash;and from whatever other sources he consulted. It may be
beyond our powers to discover the precise edition that he thus employed.
It does not at first thought seem likely that he would select the
Princeps, which does not include the eighth book at all, and contains
errors that later were weeded out. In the portion of text included in
<i>Π</i>, <i>P</i> has thirty-two readings which Aldus avoids. In most
of these cases <i>p</i> commits an error, sometimes a ridiculous error,
like <i>offam</i> for <i>officia</i> (62, 25); the manuscript on which
<i>p</i> was based apparently made free use of abbreviations. Keil’s
damning estimate of <i>r</i><a name = "tagII_50" href =
"#noteII_50"><sup>50</sup></a> is amply borne out in this section of the
text; Aldus differs from <i>r</i> in sixty-five cases, most of these
being errors in <i>r</i>. He agrees with <i>ς</i> in all but twenty-six
readings.<a name = "tagII_51" href = "#noteII_51"><sup>51</sup></a>
Aldus would have had fewest changes to make, then, if his basic text was
ς. This is apparently the view of Keil,<a name = "tagII_52" href =
"#noteII_52"><sup>52</sup></a> who would agree at any rate that Aldus
made special use of the ς editions and who also declares that <i>p</i>
is the <i>fundamentum</i> of <i>r</i> as <i>r</i> is of the edition of
Pomponius Laetus.<a name = "tagII_53" href =
"#noteII_53"><sup>53</sup></a></p>

<p>It would certainly be natural for Aldus to start with his immediate
predecessors, as they had started with theirs. The matter ought to be
cleared up, if possible, for in order to determine what Aldus found in
<i>P</i> we must know whether he took some text as a point of departure
and, if so, what that text was. But the task should be undertaken by
some one to whom the early editions are accessible. Keil’s report of
them, intentionally incomplete,<a name = "tagII_54" href =
"#noteII_54"><sup>54</sup></a> is sufficient, he declares,<a name =
"tagII_55" href = "#noteII_55"><sup>55</sup></a> “<i>ad fidem Aldinae
editionis constituendam</i>,” but, as I have found by comparing our
photographs of the edition of Beroaldus in the present section, Keil has
not collated minutely or accurately enough to encourage us to undertake,
on the basis of his apparatus, an elaborate study of Aldus’s relation to
the editions preceding his own.</p>

<a name = "aldus_2">The variants of Budaeus in the Bodleian volume</a>
</span>
We may now test Aldus by the evidence of the Bodleian volume with its
variants in the hand of Budaeus. For the section included in <i>Π</i>,
their number is disappointingly small. The only additions by Budaeus
(=&nbsp;<i>i</i>) to the text of Beroaldus are: 61, 14 sera]
<i>MVDoa</i>, (<i>m. 1</i>) <i>Π</i> serua <i>BFuxi</i>, (<i>m. 2</i>)
<i>Π</i>; 62, 4 ambulat] <i>i cum plerisque</i> ambulabat <i>r Ber.</i>
(ab <i>del.</i>) <i>M</i>; 62, 25 quoque] <i>i cum ceteris</i> p̷ouq
(ue) <i>Ber.</i>; 64, 23 Quamvis] q Vmuis <i>Ber.</i> <i>corr.
i.</i></p>

<p>This is all. Budaeus, who, according to Merrill, had the Parisinus at
his disposal, has corrected two obvious misprints, made an inevitable
change in the tense of a verb&mdash;with or without the help of the
ancient book&mdash;and introduced from that book one unfortunate reading
which we find in the second hand of <i>Π</i>.</p>

<p>There is one feature of Budaeus’s marginal jottings that at once
arouses the curiosity of the textual critic, namely, the frequent
appearance of the <i>obelus</i> and the <i>obelus cum puncto</i>. These
signs as used by Probus<a name = "tagII_56" href =
"#noteII_56"><sup>56</sup></a> would denote respectively a surely
spurious and a possibly spurious line or portion of text. But such was
not the usage of Budaeus; he employed the obelus merely to call
attention to something that interested him. Thus at the end of the first
letter of Book III we find a doubly pointed obelus opposite an
interesting passage, the text of which shows no variants or editorial
questionings. Budaeus appears to have expressed his grades of interest
rather elaborately&mdash;at least I can discover no other purpose for
the different signs employed. The simple obelus apparently denotes
interest, the pointed obelus great interest, the doubly pointed obelus
intense interest, and the pointing finger of a carefully drawn hand
burning interest. He also adds catchwords. Thus on the first letter he
calls attention successively<a name = "tagII_57" href =
"#noteII_57"><sup>57</sup></a> to <i>Ambulatio</i>, <i>Gestatio</i>,
<i>Hora balnei</i>, <i>pilae ludus</i>, <i>Coena</i>, and
<i>Comoedi</i>. The purpose of the doubly pointed obelus is plainly
indicated here, as it accompanies two of these catchwords. Just so in
the margin opposite 65, 17, a pointing finger is accompanied by the
remark, “<i>Beneficia beneficiis aliis cumulanda</i>,” while 227, 5 is
decorated with the moral ejaculation, “<i>o hominem in diuitiis
miserum</i>.” Incidentally, it is obvious that the Morgan fragment was
once perused by some thoughtful reader, who marked with lines or
brackets passages of special interest to him. For example, the account
of how Spurinna spent his day<a name = "tagII_58" href =
"#noteII_58"><sup>58</sup></a> is so marked. This passage likewise
called forth various marginal notes from Budaeus,<a name = "tagII_59"
href = "#noteII_59"><sup>59</sup></a> and other coincidences exist
between the markings in <i>Π</i> and the marginalia in the Bodleian
volume. But there is not enough evidence of this sort to warrant the
suggestion that Budaeus himself added the marks in <i>Π</i>.</p>

</span>
It is of some importance to consider what Budaeus might have done to the
text of Beroaldus had he treated it to a systematic collation with the
Parisinus. Our fragment allows us to test Budaeus; for even if it be not
the Parisinus itself,
<span class = "pagenum">60</span>
<a name = "page_60"> </a>
its readings with the help of <i>B</i>, <i>F</i>, and Aldus show what
was in that ancient book. I have enumerated above<a name = "tagII_60"
href = "#noteII_60"><sup>60</sup></a> eleven readings of <i>ΠBF</i>
which are called errors by Keil, but of which nine were accepted by
Aldus and five by the latest editor, Professor Merrill. In two of these
(62, 33 and 64, 3), Budaeus, like Aldus, wisely does not harbor an
obvious error of <i>P</i>. In two more (62, 16 and 65, 12), Beroaldus
already has the reading of <i>P</i>. Of the remaining seven, however,
all of which Aldus adopted, there is no trace in Budaeus. There are also
nineteen cases of obvious error in the ς editions, which Aldus corrected
but Budaeus did not touch. I give the complete apparatus<a name =
"tagII_61" href = "#noteII_61"><sup>61</sup></a> for these twenty-six
places, as they will illustrate the radical difference between Aldus and
Budaeus in their use of the Parisinus.</p>

<p>Here is sufficient material for a test. Aldus, it will be observed,
whether or not he started with some special edition, refuses to follow
the latest and best texts of his day (i.e., <i>ς</i>) in these
twenty-six readings. In one sure case (60, 15) and eleven possible<a
name = "tagII_62" href = "#noteII_62"><sup>62</sup></a> cases (61, 18;
62, 26; 63, 5, 12, 15, 17 <i>bis</i>, 23 <i>bis</i>; 64, 2, 5), his
reading agrees with the Princeps. In four sure cases (63, 4, 22; 65, 15;
66, 9) and one possible one (63, 9), he agrees with the Roman edition;
in two sure (61, 12; 66, 11) and three possible (63, 2; 66, 7, 12)
cases, with both <i>p</i> and <i>r</i>. Once he breaks away from all
editions reported by Keil and agrees with <i>D</i> (62, 6). At the same
time, all these readings are attested by <i>ΠFB</i> and hence were
presumably in the Parisinus. In two cases (65, 11, 24), we know of no
source other than <i>P</i> that could have furnished him his reading.
Further, in the superscription of the third letter of Book III (63, 20),
he might have taken a hint from Catanaeus, who was the first to depart
from the reading <span class = "smallcaps">corneliae</span>, universally
accepted before him, but again it is only <i>P</i> that could give him
the correct spelling <span class = "smallcaps">corelliae</span>.<a name
= "tagII_63" href = "#noteII_63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>

<p>If all the above readings, then, were in the Parisinus, how did Aldus
arrive at them? Did he fish round, now in the Princeps, now in the Roman
edition, despite the repellent errors that those texts contained,<a name
= "tagII_64" href = "#noteII_64"><sup>64</sup></a> and extract with
felicitous accuracy excellent readings that coincided with those of the
Parisinus, or did he draw them straight from that source itself? The
crucial cases are 65, 11 and 24. As he must have gone to the Parisinus
for these readings, he presumably found the others there, too. Moreover,
he did not get his new variants by a merely sporadic consultation of the
ancient book when he was dissatisfied with the accepted text of his day,
for in the two crucial cases and many of the others, too, that text
makes sense; some of the readings, indeed, are accepted by modern
editors as correct.<a name = "tagII_65" href =
"#noteII_65"><sup>65</sup></a> Aldus was collating. He carefully noted
minutiae, such as the omission of <i>et</i> and <i>iam</i>, and accepted
what he found, unless the ancient text seemed to him indisputably wrong.
He gave it the benefit of the doubt even when it may be wrong. This is
the method of a scrupulous editor who cherishes a proper veneration for
his oldest and best authority.</p>

<p>Budaeus, on the other hand, is not an editor. He is a vastly
interested reader
<span class = "pagenum">62</span>
<a name = "page_62"> </a>
of Pliny, frequently commenting on the subject-matter or calling
attention to it by marginal signs. As for the text, he generally finds
Beroaldus good enough. He corrects misprints, makes a conjecture now and
then, or adopts one of Catanaeus, and, besides supplementing the missing
portions with transcripts made for him from the Parisinus, inserts
numerous variants, some of which indubitably come from that
manuscript.<a name = "tagII_66" href = "#noteII_66"><sup>66</sup></a> In
the present section, occupying 251 lines in <i>Π</i>, there is only one
reading of the Parisinus&mdash;a false reading, it happens&mdash;that
seems to Budaeus worth recording. Compared with what Aldus gleaned from
<i>Π</i>, Budaeus’s extracts are insignificant. It is remarkable, for
instance, that on a passage (65, 11) which, as the appended obelus
shows, he must have read with attention, he has not added the very
different reading of the Parisinus. Either, then, Budaeus did not
consult the Parisinus with care, or he did not think the great majority
of its readings preferable to the text of Beroaldus, or, as I think may
well have been the case, he had neither the manuscript itself nor an
entire copy of it accessible at the time when he added his variants in
his combined edition of Beroaldus and Avantius.<a name = "tagII_67" href
= "#noteII_67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>

<p>But I do not mean to present here a final estimate of Budaeus; for
that, I hope, we may look to Professor Merrill. Nor do I particularly
blame Budaeus for not constructing a new text from the wealth of
material disclosed in the Parisinus. His interests lay elsewhere;
<i>suos quoique mos</i>. What I mean to say, and to say with some
conviction, is that for the portion of text included in our fragment,
the evidence of that fragment, coupled with that of <i>B</i> and
<i>F</i>, shows that as a witness to the ancient manuscript Aldus is
overwhelmingly superior to either Budaeus or any of the ancient
editors.</p>

<p>Our examination of the Morgan fragment, therefore, leads to what I
deem a highly probable conclusion. We could perhaps hope for absolute
proof in a matter of this kind only if another page of the same
manuscript should appear, bearing a note in the hand of Aldus Manutius
to the effect that he had used the codex for his edition of 1508.
Failing that, we can at least point out that all the data accessible
comport with the hypothesis that the Morgan fragment was a part of this
very codex. We have set our hypothesis running a lengthy gauntlet of
facts, and none has tripped it yet. We have also seen that <i>Π</i> is
most intimately connected with manuscripts <i>BF</i> of Class I, and
indeed seems to be a part of the very manuscript whence they are
descended. Finally, a careful comparison of Aldus’s text
<span class = "pagenum">63</span>
<a name = "page_63"> </a>
with <i>Π</i> shows him, for this much of the <i>Letters</i> at least,
to be a scrupulous and conscientious editor. His method is to follow
<i>Π</i> throughout, save when, confronted by its obvious blunders, he
has recourse to the editions of his day.</p>

<span class = "sidenote">
<a name = "aldus_4">The latest criticism of Aldus</a>
</span>
Since the publication of Otto’s article in 1886,<a name = "tagII_68"
href = "#noteII_68"><sup>68</sup></a> in which the author defended the
<i>F</i> branch against that of <i>MV</i>, to which, as the elder
representative of the tradition, Keil had not unnaturally deferred,
critical procedure has gradually shifted its centre. The reappearance of
<i>B</i> greatly helped, as it corroborates the testimony of <i>F</i>.
<i>B</i> and <i>F</i> head the list of the manuscripts used by Kukula in
his edition of 1912,<a name = "tagII_69" href =
"#noteII_69"><sup>69</sup></a> and <i>B</i> and <i>F</i> with Aldus’s
Parisinus make up Class I, not Class II, in Merrill’s grouping of the
manuscripts. Obviously, the value of Class I mounts higher still now
that we have evidence in the Morgan fragment of its existence in the
early sixth century. This fact helps us to decide the question of
glosses in our text. We are more than ever disposed to attribute not to
<i>BF</i> but to what has now become the younger branch of the
tradition, Class II, the tendency to interpolate explanatory glosses.
The changed attitude towards the <i>BF</i> branch has naturally resulted
in a gradual transformation of the text. We have seen in the portion
included in <i>Π</i> that of the eleven readings which Keil regarded as
errors of the <i>F</i> branch, three are accepted by Kukula and five by
Merrill.<a name = "tagII_70" href = "#noteII_70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>

<p>Since Class I has thus appreciated in value, we should expect that
Aldus’s stock would also take an upward turn. In Aldus’s lifetime,
curiously, he was criticized for excessive conservatism. His rival
Catanaeus finds his chief quality <i>supina ignorantia</i> and adds:<a
name = "tagII_71" href = "#noteII_71"><sup>71</sup></a></p>

<p class = "inset1">
“Verum enim uero non satis est recuperare venerandae vetustatis
exemplaria, nisi etiam simul adsit acre emendatoris iudicium: quoniam et
veteres librarii in voluminibus describendis saepissime falsi sunt, et
Plinius ipse scripta sua se viuo deprauari in quadam epistola
demonstrauerit.”</p>

<p>Nowadays, however, editors hesitate to accept an unsupported reading
of Aldus as that of the Parisinus, since they believe that he abounds in
those very conjectures of which Catanaeus felt the lack. The attitude of
the expert best qualified to judge is still one of suspicion towards
Aldus. In his most recent article,<a name = "tagII_72" href =
"#noteII_72"><sup>72</sup></a> Professor Merrill declares that Keil’s
remarks<a name = "tagII_73" href = "#noteII_73"><sup>73</sup></a> on the
procedure of Aldus in the part of Book X already edited by Avantius,
Beroaldus, and Catanaeus might safely have been extended to cover the
work of Aldus on the entire body of the <i>Letters</i>. He proceeds to
subject Aldus to a new test, the material for which we owe to Merrill’s
own researches. He compares with Aldus’s text the manuscript parts of
the Bodleian
<span class = "pagenum">64</span>
<a name = "page_64"> </a>
volume, which are apparently transcripts from the Parisinus
(=&nbsp;<i>I</i>);<a name = "tagII_74" href =
"#noteII_74"><sup>74</sup></a> in them Budaeus with his own hand
(=&nbsp;<i>i</i>) has corrected on the authority of the Parisinus
itself, according to Merrill, the errors of his transcriber. In a few
instances, Merrill allows, Budaeus has substituted conjectures of his
own. This material, obviously, offers a valuable criterion of Aldus’s
methods as an editor. There is a further criterion in the shape of Codex
<i>M</i>, not utilized till after Aldus’s edition. As this manuscript
represents Class II, concurrences between <i>M</i> and <i>Ii</i> against
<i>a</i> make it tolerably certain that Aldus himself and no higher
authority is responsible for such readings. On this basis, Merrill cites
twenty-five readings in the added part of Book VIII (viii, 3 <i>quas
obvias</i>&mdash;xviii, II <i>amplissimos hortos</i>) and nineteen
readings in the added part of Book X (letters iv-xli), which represent
examples “wherein Aldus abandons indubitably satisfactory readings of
his only and much belauded manuscript in favor of conjectures of his
own.”<a name = "tagII_75" href = "#noteII_75"><sup>75</sup></a> Letter
IX xvi, a very short affair, added by Budaeus in the margin, contains no
indictment against Aldus.</p>


<p class = "section">
<span class = "sidenote">
<a name = "aldus_5">Aldus’s methods in the newly discovered parts
of Books VIII, IX, and X</a>
</span>
The result of this exposure, Professor Merrill declares, should convince
“any unprejudiced student” of the question that “Aldus stands clearly
convicted of being an extremely unsafe textual critic of Pliny’s
<i>Letters</i>.”<a name = "tagII_76" href =
"#noteII_76"><sup>76</sup></a> “This conclusion does not depend, as that
of Keil necessarily did, on any native or acquired acuteness of critical
perception. The wayfaring man, though a fool, need not err therein.”<a
name = "tagII_77" href = "#noteII_77"><sup>77</sup></a> I speak as a
wayfarer, but nevertheless I must own that Professor Merrill’s path of
argument causes me to stumble. I readily admit that Aldus, in editing a
portion of text that no man had put into print before him, fell back on
conjecture when his authority seemed not to make sense. But Merrill’s
lists need revision. He has included with Aldus’s “willful deviations”
from the true text of <i>P</i> certain readings that almost surely were
misprints (218, 12; 220, 3), some that may well be (as 217, 28; 221,
12), one case in which Aldus has retained an error of <i>P</i> while
<i>I</i> emends (221, 11), and several cases in which Aldus and <i>I</i>
or <i>i</i> emend in different ways an error of <i>P</i> (222, 14; 226,
5; 272, 4&mdash;not 5). In one case he misquotes Aldus, when the latter
really has the reading that both Merrill and Keil indicate as correct
(276, 21); in another he fails to remark that Aldus’s erroneous reading
is supported by <i>M</i> (219,17). However, even after discounting these
and possibly other instances, a significant array of conjectures
remains. Still, it is not fair to call the Parisinus Aldus’s <i>only</i>
manuscript. We know that he had other material in the six volumes of
manuscripts and collated editions sent him by Giocondo, as well as the
latter’s copy of <i>P</i>. There could hardly have been in this number a
source superior to the Parisinus, but Giocondo may have added here and
there his own or others’ conjectures, which Aldus adopted unwisely, but
at least not solely on his own authority; the most
<span class = "pagenum">65</span>
<a name = "page_65"> </a>
apparent case of interpolation (224, 8) Keil thought might have been a
conjecture of Giocondo’s. Further, if the general character of <i>P</i>
is represented in <i>Π</i>, Book X, as well as the beginning of Book
III, may have had variants by the second hand, sometimes taken by Aldus
and neglected, wisely, by Budaeus’s transcriber.</p>


<p class = "section">
<span class = "sidenote">
<a name = "aldus_6">The Morgan fragment the best criterion of Aldus</a>
</span>
With the discovery of the Morgan fragment, a new criterion of Aldus is
offered. I believe that it is the surest starting-point from which to
investigate Aldus’s relation to his ancient manuscript. I admit that for
Book X, Avantius and the Bodleian volume in its added parts are better
authorities for the Parisinus than is Aldus. I admit that Aldus resorted
throughout the text of the <i>Letters</i>&mdash;in some cases
unhappily&mdash;to the customary editorial privilege of emendation. But
I nevertheless maintain that for the entire text he is a much better
authority than the Bodleian volume as a whole, and that he should be
given, not absolute confidence, but far more confidence than editors
have thus far allowed him. Nor is the section of text preserved in the
fragment of small significance for our purpose. Indeed, both for Aldus
and in general, I think it even more valuable than a corresponding
amount of Book X would be. We could wish that it were longer, but at
least it includes a number of crucial readings and above all vouches for
the existence of the indices some two hundred years before the date
previously assigned for their compilation. It also supplies a final
confirmation of the value of Class I; indeed, <i>B</i> and <i>F</i>, the
manuscripts of this class, appear to have descended from the very
manuscript of which <i>Π</i> was a part. We see still more clearly than
before that <i>BF</i> can be used elsewhere in the <i>Letters</i> as a
test of Aldus, and we also note that these manuscripts contain errors
not in the Parisinus. This is a highly important factor for forming a
true estimate of Aldus and one that we could not deduce from a fragment
of Book X, which <i>BF</i> do not contain.</p>


<p class = "section">
<span class = "sidenote">
<a name = "aldus_7">Conclusion</a>
</span>
I conclude, then, that the Morgan fragment is a piece of the Parisinus,
and that we may compare with Aldus’s text the very words which he
studied out, carefully collated, and treated with a decent respect. On
the basis of the new information furnished us by the fragment, I shall
endeavor, at some future time, to confirm my present judgement of Aldus
by testing him in the entire text of Pliny’s <i>Letters</i>. Further,
despite Merrill’s researches and his brilliant analysis, I am not
convinced that the last word has been spoken on the nature of the
transcript made for Budaeus and incorporated in the Bodleian volume. I
will not, however, venture on this broad field until Professor Merrill,
who has the first right to speak, is enabled to give to the world his
long-expected edition. Meanwhile, if my view is right, we owe to the
acquisition of the ancient fragment by the Pierpont Morgan Library a new
confidence in the integrity of Aldus, a clearer understanding of the
history of the <i>Letters</i> in the early Middle Ages, and a surer
method of editing their text.</p>

I would acknowledge most gratefully the help given me in the preparation
of this part of our discussion by Professor E.&nbsp;T. Merrill, of the
University of Chicago. Professor Merrill, whose edition of the
<i>Letters</i> of Pliny has long been in the hands of Teubner, placed at
my disposal his proof-sheets for the part covered in the Morgan
fragment, his preliminary <i>apparatus criticus</i> for the entire text
of the <i>Letters</i>, and a card-catalogue of the readings of <i>B</i>
and <i>F</i>. He patiently answered numerous questions and subjected the
first draft of my argument to a searching criticism which saved me from
errors in fact and in expression. But Professor Merrill should not be
held responsible for errors that remain or for my estimate of the Morgan
fragment.

The spellings <i>Karet</i> and <i>Karitas</i>, whether Pliny’s or not,
are a sign of antiquity. In the first century A.D., as we see from
Velius Longus (p. 53, 12 K) and Quintilian (I, 7, 10), certain
old-timers clung to the use of <i>k</i> for <i>c</i> when the vowel
<i>a</i> followed. By the fourth century, theorists of the opposite
tendency proposed the abandonment of <i>k</i> and <i>q</i> as
superfluous letters, since their functions were performed by <i>c</i>.
Donatus (p. 368, 7 K) and Diomedes, too, according to Keil (p. 423, 11),
still believed in the rule of <i>ka</i> for <i>ca</i>, but these rigid
critics had passed away in the time of Servius, who, in his commentary
on Donatus (p. 422, 35 K), remarks <i>k vero et q aliter nos utimur,
aliter usi sunt maiores nostri. Namque illi, quotienscumque a
sequebatur, k praeponebant in omni parte orationis, ut Kaput et similia;
nos vero non usurpamus k litteram nisi in Kalendarum nomine
scribendo.</i> See also Cledonius (p. 28, 5K); W. Brambach, <i>Latein.
Orthog.</i> 1868, pp. 210 ff.; W.&nbsp;M. Lindsay,
<i>The Latin Language</i>,
1894, pp. 6 f. There would thus be no temptation for a scribe at the end
of the fifth century or the beginning of the sixth to adopt <i>ka</i>
for <i>ca</i> as a habit. The writer of our fragment was copying
faithfully from his original a spelling that he apparently would not
have used himself. There are various other cases of <i>ca</i> in our
text (<i>e.g.</i>, <i>calceos</i>, III, i, 4; <i>canere</i>, 11), but
there we find the usual spelling. On traces of <i>ka</i> in the
Bellovacensis, see below, <a href = "#page_57">p. 57</a>.
I should not be surprised if Pliny
himself employed the spelling <i>ka</i>, which was gradually modified in
the successive copies of his work; it may be, however, that our
manuscript represents a text which had passed through the hand of some
archaeologizing scholar of a later age, like Donatus. At any rate, this
feature of our fragment is an indication of genuineness and of
antiquity.

<i>Pal. des Class. Lat.</i> pl. CXLIII.
See our <a href = "images/plate13.jpg">plates XIII</a>
and <a href = "images/plate14.jpg">XIV</a>. At
least as early as the thirteenth century, the manuscript was at
Beauvais. The ancient press-mark <i>S. Petri Beluacensis</i>, in writing
perhaps of the twelfth century, may still be discerned on the recto of
the first folio. See Merrill, <i>C.P.</i> X, p. 16. If the book was
written at Beauvais, as Chatelain thinks (<i>Journal des Savants</i>,
1900, p. 48), then something like what I call the mid-century style of
Fleury was also cultivated, possibly a bit later, in the north. The
Beauvais Horace, Leidensis lat. 28 <i>saec.</i> IX (Chatelain, pl.
LXXVIII), shows a certain similarity in the script to that of <i>B</i>.
If both were done at Beauvais, the Horace would seem to be the later
book. It belongs, we may observe, to a group of manuscripts of which a
Floriacensis (Paris lat. 7971) is a conspicuous member. To settle the
case of <i>B</i>, we need a study of all the books of Beauvais. For
this, a valuable preliminary survey is given by Omont in <i>Mém. de
l’Acad. des Ins. et Belles Lettres</i> XL (1914), pp. 1 ff.

Cod. Med. LXVIII, 1. See Rostagno in the preface to his edition of this
manuscript in the Leyden series, and for the Pliny, Chatelain, <i>Pal.
des Class. Lat.</i>, pl. CXLV. Keil (edition, p. vi), followed by Kukula
(edition, p. iv), incorrectly assigns the manuscript to the tenth
century. The latest treatment is by Paul Lehmann in his “Corveyer
Studien,” in <i>Abhandl. der Bayer. Akad. der Wiss. Philos.-philol. u.
hist. Klasse</i>, XXX, 5 (1919), p. 38. He assigns it to the middle or
the last half of the ninth century.

Chatelain calls the page of Pliny that he reproduces (pl. CXLIV) tenth
century, but attributes the Sallust portion of the manuscript, although
this seems of a piece with the style of the Pliny, to the ninth; see pl.
LIV. Hauler, who has given the most complete account of the manuscript,
thinks it “<i>saec.</i> IX/X” (<i>Wiener Studien</i> XVII (1895), p.
124). He shows, as others had done before him, the close association of
the book with Bernensis 357, and of that codex with Fleury.

See Merrill <i>C.P.</i> X, p. 23. The catalogue (G. Becker, <i>Catalogi
bibliothecarum antiqui</i>, p. 282) was prepared about 1200, and is of
Corbie, not as Merrill has it, Corvey. Chatelain (on plate LIV) regards
the book as “provenant du monastère de Corbie.”
At my request, Mr. H.&nbsp;J.
Leon, Sheldon Fellow of Harvard University, recently examined the
manuscript, and neither he nor Monsignore Mercati, the Prefect of the
Vatican Library, could discover any note or library-mark to indicate
that the book is a Corbeiensis. In a recent article, <i>Philol.
Quart.</i> I (1922), pp. 17 ff.), Professor Ullman is inclined, after a
careful analysis of the evidence, to assign the manuscript to Corbie,
but allows for the possibility that it was written in Tours or the
neighborhood and thence sent to Corbie.

to the ninth century and is sure that the writing is French (p. 12). His
reproduction, though not photographic, gives an essentially correct idea
of the script. The text of the fragment is inferior to that of
<i>MV</i>, with which manuscripts it is undoubtedly associated. In one
error it agrees with <i>V</i> against <i>M</i>. Chatelain
(<i>Introduction à la Lecture des Notes Tironiennes</i>, 1900), though
citing De Vries’s publication in his bibliography (p. xv), does not
discuss the character of the notes in this fragment. I must leave it for
experts in tachygraphy to decide whether the style of the Tironian notes
is that of the school of Orléans.

<i>The Descent of Manuscripts</i>, 1918, p. 16. Professor Clark counts
on two pages chosen at random, 23-31 letters in the line. My count for

If I had taken only foll. 52<sup>r</sup>, 52<sup>v</sup>, 53<sup>r</sup>

the other hand, the first page to which I turned in the Vindobonensis of
Livy (133<sup>v</sup>) has a line of 32 letters, and so has
135<sup>v</sup>, while 136<sup>v</sup> has one of 33. The lines of

Certain errors of the scribe who wrote the additional pages in the
Bodleian book warrant the surmise that he was copying not the Parisinus
itself, but some copy of it. Thus in 227, 14
(see <a href = "images/plate17.jpg">plate XVII b</a>) we find
him writing <i>Tamen</i> for <i>tum</i>, Budaeus correcting this error
in the margin. A scribe is of course capable of anything, but with an
uncial <i>tum</i> to start from, <i>tamen</i> is not a natural mistake
to commit; it would rather appear that the scribe falsely resolved a
minuscule abbreviation.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
